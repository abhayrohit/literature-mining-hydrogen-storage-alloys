FeTi,-,-,-,-,"FeTi identified as a representative bcc-derived intermetallic with reversible hydrogenation near ambient conditions.; FeTi is paramagnetic under standard application temperatures, favoring ordered bcc phase.; DFT gives ΔHf(FeTi) = -0.83 eV per formula unit (‑40 kJ mol⁻¹).; Computational site‑preference shows Co and Ni strongly prefer Fe‑site substitution in FeTi.",Model focuses on para‑equilibrium hydrogenation.; Used as example of ordered AB bcc system.; Site‑preference of alloying elements on Ti vs Fe sublattice quantified.; Phase diagrams at 1273 K confirm solubility trends.
Fe2Ti,-,-,-,-,"Fe2Ti Laves phase included in equilibrium considerations with FeTiH.; Fe2Ti Laves phase shows significant Fe‑site solubility for many elements, matching formation‑energy calculations.",Continuous single‑phase region highlighted in magenta.
FeTiH,-,-,-,-,FeTiH considered as the monohydride phase in the Fe–Ti–H system for thermodynamic modeling.; Formation energies for FeTiH used to select end‑member compounds in para‑equilibrium modeling.,Equilibrium with Fe2Ti and TiH2 evaluated.; Hydride phase modeling enables prediction of hydrogen storage conditions.
FeTiH (monohydride),-,-,-,-,Substitution trends in FeTiH similar to FeTi; larger elements prefer Ti sites.,Results reported in Table S1; no explicit capacity data provided.
