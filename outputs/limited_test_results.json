    "abstract": "The hydrogen absorption and desorption properties of the Li-Mg-Al-Ti-V and Li-Mg-Al-Ti-Nb lightweight high entropy alloys (HEAs) synthesized by mechanical alloying were investigated to develop hydrogen storage alloys with high gravimetric capacity. An equiatomic Li₂₀Mg₂₀Al₂₀Ti₂₀V₂₀ consists of two phases; a Ti-V based bodycentered cubic (BCC) phase and a Li-Mg based BCC phase. The alloy absorbs hydrogen up to H/M = 0.74 (2.3 wt% H₂) at 250 ℃, although the hydrogen absorption and desorption induced phase separation of Mg from the Li-Mg based BCC phase. The hydrogen absorption and desorption properties of each Li₈Mg₈Al₂₈Ti₂₈V₂₈ and Li₈Mg₈Al₂₈Ti₂₈Nb₂₈ single BCC phases were also investigated. At room temperature, they absorbed hydrogen up to H/M = 0.43 (1.1 wt% H₂) and H/M = 0.68 (1.4 wt% H₂), respectively. Unlike Li₂₀Mg₂₀Al₂₀Ti₂₀V₂₀, no clear phase separation was observed in these alloys after hydrogen absorption and desorption.",

    "abstract": "Mg₂Ni is considered a promising candidate for hydrogen storage materials due to its reasonable hydrogenation and dehydrogenation kinetics and cost-effectiveness. However, the high thermodynamic stability of Mg₂NiH₄ poses a significant challenge in terms of the operating temperature required for hydrogen release. This study investigates the crystal and electronic structure, and thermodynamic stability of Iron-doped Mg₂NiH₄ and their alloys using first-principles calculations based on density functional theory. The results demonstrate that by replacing one in sixteen Mg atoms and one in eight Ni atoms with Fe, the enthalpy of hydrogen desorption can be reduced from 65.173 to 57.58 and 50.72 kJ/mol H₂, respectively. Furthermore, the study clarifies the crystal structure and electron properties of Fe-doped Mg₂Ni and Mg₂NiH₄, highlighting the significant role of weakened covalent interactions in the H–Ni bonding that contribute to the reduced thermodynamic stability of the hy­ drides. This study demonstrates that ionic conductivity improves with the destabilization of Mg₂NiH₄, achieving up to 5 × 91.10- 1 S/cm for Mg₁₅FeNi₈H₃₂ at 400 K. Substituting magnesium (Mg) with iron (Fe) significantly impacts the electronic structure of the material. The additional d-electrons from Fe enhance the density of electronic states near the Fermi level, leading to increased charge carrier mobility and, consequently, higher conductivity. In contrast, replacing nickel (Ni) with Fe has a less pronounced effect, as both Ni and Fe are transition metals with similar electronic configurations and d-electrons near the Fermi level. This results in fewer new electronic states and a smaller increase in conductivity compared to Mg substitution.",

    "abstract": "Metal hydrides are considered as an important group of materials in the future hydrogen-based economy. Their development is mostly based on time-consuming experimental trial-and-error methods. This work accelerates this pathway using a computational framework for the thermodynamic modeling of metal hydrides under para-equilibrium conditions. By employing the CALPHAD method on a six-component AB₅-type (Ce, La)(Ni, Al, Fe, Mn)₅–H system, we are able to make precise predictions regarding hydrogen absorption enthalpies, plateau pressures, and hydrogen sorption capacities. Additionally, this is the first time the hydrogenation/dehydroganation hysteresis effect has been successfully modeled using separate thermodynamic databases for hydrogen absorption and desorption. Furthermore, we introduce a method to directly calculate sloped pressure–composition–temperature (PCT) curves from X-ray diffraction data. This validation demonstrates the framework’s capability to assess the hydrogen storage properties of complex multi-component systems in an efficient manner. This work lays the groundwork for future metal hydride thermodynamic studies on a variety of material classes, as well as optimization of alloys for applications even beyond classical hydrogen storage.",
