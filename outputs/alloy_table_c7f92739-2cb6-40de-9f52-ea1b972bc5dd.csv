Ti0.5Fe0.45Mn0.05,1.68 wt% at 25 °C,0–50 °C,1–40 bar,"induction furnace melting at 1300 °C under Ar, cast in a copper mold; as-cast ingot (contact with copper mold)","Elastic modulus ~198 GPa (macroscopic) and Young’s modulus 269 GPa (ultrasonic).; elastic modulus estimates differ across ultrasonic, compression, and nanoindentation techniques; Elastic modulus measured overall 198 GPa, varying 186–215 GPa with compression; Mean indentation elastic modulus 294 ± 60 GPa; domain moduli 265–384 GPa and hardness 9.2–25.4 GPa.",Four elastic domains identified; high variability (163–229 GPa).; cylindrical specimens (10 mm × 15 mm) used; DIC employed for strain measurement; Strong microscale heterogeneity observed in nanoindentation; Heterogeneous microstructure; pre‑existing cracks lower macroscopic stiffness.
TiFe,-,-,-,-,Mean Young's modulus 271 ± 43 GPa (range 213–352 GPa); Poisson's ratio 0.26 ± 0.04 (0.19–0.31).; Young’s modulus 269 GPa and Poisson’s ratio 0.29 measured for TiFe.,"Elastic anisotropy observed in single crystals.; Macroscopic compression modulus 163–229 GPa, affected by pre‑existing cracks."
TiFeMn,-,-,-,"induction furnace melting at 1300 °C under Ar, cast in a copper mold",micro‑cracking improves absorption–desorption kinetics,alloy studied for mechanical behavior; samples with internal cracks were excluded
TiFe2,-,-,-,-,Mean Young's modulus 252 ± 18 GPa (226–295 GPa); Poisson's ratio 0.28 ± 0.02 (0.22–0.30).; Indentation modulus of TiFe2 (~274 GPa) is slightly lower than TiFe.,"Anisotropic elastic response, lower than TiFe.; λ‑Laves phase presence reduces elasticity compared with TiFe."
FeTi,-,-,-,-,Mean indentation elastic modulus 284 ± 6 GPa (274–295 GPa).,Indentation reduces anisotropy compared to uniaxial tests.
TiFeMn (Ti0.5Fe0.45Mn0.05),-,-,-,-,Indentation elastic modulus 265–333 GPa; hardness 9.2–18.7 GPa for TiFeMn alloy.,Nitride/carbide precipitates reach 385 GPa modulus and 25.4 GPa hardness.
