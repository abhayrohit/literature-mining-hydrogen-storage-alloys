1,Hydrogen absorption and desorption properties of Li-Mg-Al-Ti-M based lightweight high entropy alloys,"H., Hashimoto, Hirotada; S., Isobe, Shigehito; T., Minami, Tatsuya; K., Asano, Kohta; K., Sakaki, Kouji; N., Hashimoto, Naoyuki; H., Oka, Hiroshi",2025,10.1016/j.nxmate.2025.101067,"The hydrogen absorption and desorption properties of the Li-Mg-Al-Ti-V and Li-Mg-Al-Ti-Nb lightweight high entropy alloys (HEAs) synthesized by mechanical alloying were investigated to develop hydrogen storage alloys with high gravimetric capacity. An equiatomic Li₂₀Mg₂₀Al₂₀Ti₂₀V₂₀ consists of two phases; a Ti-V based bodycentered cubic (BCC) phase and a Li-Mg based BCC phase. The alloy absorbs hydrogen up to H/M = 0.74 (2.3 wt% H₂) at 250 ℃, although the hydrogen absorption and desorption induced phase separation of Mg from the Li-Mg based BCC phase. The hydrogen absorption and desorption properties of each Li₈Mg₈Al₂₈Ti₂₈V₂₈ and Li₈Mg₈Al₂₈Ti₂₈Nb₂₈ single BCC phases were also investigated. At room temperature, they absorbed hydrogen up to H/M = 0.43 (1.1 wt% H₂) and H/M = 0.68 (1.4 wt% H₂), respectively.

K.; A.E., Hajjaji, Abdelowahed El",2025,10.1016/j.mtsust.2025.101172,"Mg₂Ni is considered a promising candidate for hydrogen storage materials due to its reasonable hydrogenation and dehydrogenation kinetics and cost-effectiveness. However, the high thermodynamic stability of Mg₂NiH₄ poses a significant challenge in terms of the operating temperature required for hydrogen release. This study investigates the crystal and electronic structure, and thermodynamic stability of Iron-doped Mg₂NiH₄ and their alloys using first-principles calculations based on density functional theory. The results demonstrate that by replacing one in sixteen Mg atoms and one in eight Ni atoms with Fe, the enthalpy of hydrogen desorption can be reduced from 65.173 to 57.58 and 50.72 kJ/mol H₂, respectively. Furthermore, the study clarifies the crystal structure and electron properties of Fe-doped Mg₂Ni and Mg₂NiH₄, highlighting the significant role of weakened covalent interactions in the H–Ni bonding that contribute to the reduced thermodynamic stability of the hy­ drides. This study demonstrates that ionic conductivity improves with the destabilization of Mg₂NiH₄, achieving up to 5 × 91.10- 1 S/cm for Mg₁₅FeNi₈H₃₂ at 400 K. Substituting magnesium (Mg) with iron (Fe) significantly impacts the electronic structure of the material. The additional d-electrons from Fe enhance the density of electronic states near the Fermi level, leading to increased charge carrier mobility and, consequently, higher conductivity. In contrast, replacing nickel (Ni) with Fe has a less pronounced effect, as both Ni and Fe are transition metals with similar electronic configurations and d-electrons near the Fermi level. This results in fewer new electronic states and a smaller increase in conductivity compared to Mg substitution.",data/pdfs/2025_Belkoufa.pdf,Fe-doped Mg₂NiH₄,,No direct capacity reported - theoretical study focusing on thermodynamic stability,DFT calculation,400 K for ionic conductivity measurements,"Reduced desorption enthalpy, improved ionic conductivity, cost-effective base material",High thermodynamic stability requiring elevated temperatures,rule_based_extraction,0.7,data/raw_text/2.txt

Their development is mostly based on time-consuming experimental trial-and-error methods. This work accelerates this pathway using a computational framework for the thermodynamic modeling of metal hydrides under para-equilibrium conditions. By employing the CALPHAD method on a six-component AB₅-type (Ce, La)(Ni, Al, Fe, Mn)₅–H system, we are able to make precise predictions regarding hydrogen absorption enthalpies, plateau pressures, and hydrogen sorption capacities. Additionally, this is the first time the hydrogenation/dehydroganation hysteresis effect has been successfully modeled using separate thermodynamic databases for hydrogen absorption and desorption. Furthermore, we introduce a method to directly calculate sloped pressure–composition–temperature (PCT) curves from X-ray diffraction data. This validation demonstrates the framework's capability to assess the hydrogen storage properties of complex multi-component systems in an efficient manner.

4,Vanadium induces Ni-Co MOF formation from a NiCo LDH to catalytically enhance the MgH2 hydrogen storage performance,"Z., Yang, Zexuan; Y., Wang, Yazhou; X., Lin, Xia; Y.J., Zou, Yongjing Jin; C.L., Xiang, Cuilin Li; F., Xu, Fen; L., Sun, Lixian; Y.S., Chua, Yong Shen",2025,10.1016/j.jma.2025.01.012,"Magnesium-based hydrogen storage materials, such as MgH₂, have attracted considerable attention because of its superior hydrogen storage capacities, inexpensive, and excellent reversibility. However, their high thermodynamic stabilities and slow kinetics lead to relatively high desorption temperatures, which severely limit the wide application of MgH₂. In this study, the inclusion of vanadium induced the formation Ni-Co metal–organic frameworks (MOF) from a NiCo layered double hydroxide (LDH), thereby increasing the number of defects and vacancies, and improving the hydrogen storage properties of MgH₂. The synthesized NiCo-MOF/V-O-doped MgH₂ system demonstrates excellent hydrogen storage capacity. More specifically, 5 wt.% of H₂ was released over 20 min at a relatively low dehydrogenation temperature of 250 °C, and almost complete dehydrogenation was achieved at 300 °C for 5 min. In addition, at 125 °C, the hydrogen storage material absorbed 5.5 wt.% H₂ in 10 min. Furthermore, the activation energy of dehydrogenation was determined to be 69.588 ± 6.302 kJ·mol⁻¹ which is significantly lower than that of the ball-milled MgH₂ (i.e., 118.649 ± 2.825 kJ·mol⁻¹). It was therefore inferred that during dehydrogenation process, a Mg₂Ni/Mg₂NiH₄ hydrogen pump is formed by Ni, while the V-H and Co-H bonds formed by Co and V during the reaction act synergistically to catalyze the absorption and desorption of hydrogen, thereby increasing the hydrogen storage capacity of MgH₂. These experiments provide new perspectives on the commercial application of MgH₂.",data/pdfs/2025_Yang.pdf,NiCo-MOF/V-O-doped MgH₂,5.5,"5.5 wt% absorbed at 125°C, 5 wt% released at 250°C",MOF synthesis from LDH precursor,"125°C absorption, 250-300°C desorption","Superior storage capacity, fast kinetics, reduced activation energy",High thermodynamic stability and slow kinetics of base MgH₂,rule_based_extraction,0.9,data/raw_text/4.txt

Alloying has emerged as a highly promising strategy to overcome these challenges. In this study, we synthesized a series of Mg₉₃–Ni₇₋ₓ-Siₓ (x = 0.4, 1.6, 5) ternary alloys through microstructure optimization and particle refinement using melting and high energy ball milling techniques. We systematically investigated the effects of varying Ni and Si content on the microstructure and hydrogen storage properties of Mg-Ni-Si alloys. The results demonstrate that variations in Ni and Si content leads to the formation of different types of intermetallic compounds within the alloys, thereby influencing their hydrogen storage properties. Among the tested alloys, Mg₉₃Ni₂Si₅ exhibits superior activation and hydrogen absorption properties. The enhanced hydrogenation performance can be attributed to the precipitation of the Mg₂Si phase resulting from increased Si content, as well as the refinement of the Mg₂Ni₃Si phase and the increase in eutectic structure Mg+Mg₁₁Ni₁₂Si₁₀. Significantly, the increased intermetallic compounds provide a large number of sites and channels for the nucleation of hydrides as well as the diffusion of hydrogen. During the dehydrogenation process, Ni, serves as the predominant catalytic species, effectively promotes the dissociation of hydrogen and enhances the reaction kinetics. As a result, the hydrogen desorption of the hydrogenated Mg₉₃Ni₆.₆Si₀.₄ alloy initiates at 180 °C, with a reduced activation energy of 105.21 kJ/mol. These findings underscore the synergistic and effective roles of Ni and Si elements in enhancing the hydrogen storage properties of Mg-based materials, thus supporting the development of economically viable and promising Mg-based solid-state hydrogen storage materials.",data/pdfs/2025_Wan.pdf,Mg₉₃-Ni₇₋ₓ-Siₓ ternary alloys,,Superior absorption properties reported without specific wt% values,Melting and high energy ball milling,180°C desorption initiation,"Enhanced performance through intermetallic compounds, improved kinetics",Thermodynamic and kinetic challenges of base Mg/MgH₂,rule_based_extraction,0.7,data/raw_text/5.txt
