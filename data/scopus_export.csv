An equiatomic Li₂₀Mg₂₀Al₂₀Ti₂₀V₂₀ consists of two phases; a Ti-V based bodycentered cubic (BCC) phase and a Li-Mg based BCC phase. The alloy absorbs hydrogen up to H/M = 0.74 (2.3 wt% H₂) at 250 ℃, although the hydrogen absorption and desorption induced phase separation of Mg from the Li-Mg based BCC phase. The hydrogen absorption and desorption properties of each Li₈Mg₈Al₂₈Ti₂₈V₂₈ and Li₈Mg₈Al₂₈Ti₂₈Nb₂₈ single BCC phases were also investigated. At room temperature, they absorbed hydrogen up to H/M = 0.43 (1.1 wt% H₂) and H/M = 0.68 (1.4 wt% H₂), respectively.

However, the high thermodynamic stability of Mg₂NiH₄ poses a significant challenge in terms of the operating temperature required for hydrogen release. This study investigates the crystal and electronic structure, and thermodynamic stability of Iron-doped Mg₂NiH₄ and their alloys using first-principles calculations based on density functional theory. The results demonstrate that by replacing one in sixteen Mg atoms and one in eight Ni atoms with Fe, the enthalpy of hydrogen desorption can be reduced from 65.173 to 57.58 and 50.72 kJ/mol H₂, respectively. Furthermore, the study clarifies the crystal structure and electron properties of Fe-doped Mg₂Ni and Mg₂NiH₄, highlighting the significant role of weakened covalent interactions in the H–Ni bonding that contribute to the reduced thermodynamic stability of the hy­ drides. This study demonstrates that ionic conductivity improves with the destabilization of Mg₂NiH₄, achieving up to 5 × 91.10- 1 S/cm for Mg₁₅FeNi₈H₃₂ at 400 K. Substituting magnesium (Mg) with iron (Fe) significantly impacts the electronic structure of the material. The additional d-electrons from Fe enhance the density of electronic states near the Fermi level, leading to increased charge carrier mobility and, consequently, higher conductivity. In contrast, replacing nickel (Ni) with Fe has a less pronounced effect, as both Ni and Fe are transition metals with similar electronic configurations and d-electrons near the Fermi level. This results in fewer new electronic states and a smaller increase in conductivity compared to Mg substitution.",data/pdfs/2025_Belkoufa.pdf

Their development is mostly based on time-consuming experimental trial-and-error methods. This work accelerates this pathway using a computational framework for the thermodynamic modeling of metal hydrides under para-equilibrium conditions. By employing the CALPHAD method on a six-component AB₅-type (Ce, La)(Ni, Al, Fe, Mn)₅–H system, we are able to make precise predictions regarding hydrogen absorption enthalpies, plateau pressures, and hydrogen sorption capacities. Additionally, this is the first time the hydrogenation/dehydroganation hysteresis effect has been successfully modeled using separate thermodynamic databases for hydrogen absorption and desorption. Furthermore, we introduce a method to directly calculate sloped pressure–composition–temperature (PCT) curves from X-ray diffraction data. This validation demonstrates the framework’s capability to assess the hydrogen storage properties of complex multi-component systems in an efficient manner.

However, their high thermodynamic stabilities and slow kinetics lead to relatively high desorption temperatures, which severely limit the wide application of MgH₂. In this study, the inclusion of vanadium induced the formation Ni-Co metal–organic frameworks (MOF) from a NiCo layered double hydroxide (LDH), thereby increasing the number of defects and vacancies, and improving the hydrogen storage properties of MgH₂. The synthesized NiCo-MOF/V-O-doped MgH₂ system demonstrates excellent hydrogen storage capacity. More specifically, 5 wt.% of H₂ was released over 20 min at a relatively low dehydrogenation temperature of 250 °C, and almost complete dehydrogenation was achieved at 300 °C for 5 min. In addition, at 125 °C, the hydrogen storage material absorbed 5.5 wt.% H₂ in 10 min. Furthermore, the activation energy of dehydrogenation was determined to be 69.588 ± 6.302 kJ·mol⁻¹ which is significantly lower than that of the ball-milled MgH₂ (i.e., 118.649 ± 2.825 kJ·mol⁻¹). It was therefore inferred that during dehydrogenation process, a Mg₂Ni/Mg₂NiH₄ hydrogen pump is formed by Ni, while the V-H and Co-H bonds formed by Co and V during the reaction act synergistically to catalyze the absorption and desorption of hydrogen, thereby increasing the hydrogen storage capacity of MgH₂.

Alloying has emerged as a highly promising strategy to overcome these challenges. In this study, we synthesized a series of Mg₉₃–Ni₇₋ₓ-Siₓ (x = 0.4, 1.6, 5) ternary alloys through microstructure optimization and particle refinement using melting and high energy ball milling techniques. We systematically investigated the effects of varying Ni and Si content on the microstructure and hydrogen storage properties of Mg-Ni-Si alloys. The results demonstrate that variations in Ni and Si content leads to the formation of different types of intermetallic compounds within the alloys, thereby influencing their hydrogen storage properties. Among the tested alloys, Mg₉₃Ni₂Si₅ exhibits superior activation and hydrogen absorption properties. The enhanced hydrogenation performance can be attributed to the precipitation of the Mg₂Si phase resulting from increased Si content, as well as the refinement of the Mg₂Ni₃Si phase and the increase in eutectic structure Mg+Mg₁₁Ni₁₂Si₁₀. Significantly, the increased intermetallic compounds provide a large number of sites and channels for the nucleation of hydrides as well as the diffusion of hydrogen. During the dehydrogenation process, Ni, serves as the predominant catalytic species, effectively promotes the dissociation of hydrogen and enhances the reaction kinetics. As a result, the hydrogen desorption of the hydrogenated Mg₉₃Ni₆.₆Si₀.₄ alloy initiates at 180 °C, with a reduced activation energy of 105.21 kJ/mol. These findings underscore the synergistic and effective roles of Ni and Si elements in enhancing the hydrogen storage properties of Mg-based materials, thus supporting the development of economically viable and promising Mg-based solid-state hydrogen storage materials.",data/pdfs/2025_Wan.pdf

Specifically, the absorption capacity and diffusion rate are evaluated using hydrogen storage experiments. Thermal gas-phase hydrogenation experiments are conducted, and the hydride precipitation at different scales is characterized. First-principles calculations are performed to analyze H occupancy stability and the interactions between Al and H atoms. The experiment results demonstrate that the addition of Al reduces hydrogen absorption capacity and diffusion rate in Ti-xAl alloys. The strong attraction of Al to the H atom in octahedral interstitial site hinders the formation of Ti-H bonds, thereby suppressing the hydride nucleation. With increasing hydrogen concentration, the dominant orientation relationship (OR) shifts from OR2 ({0001}α//{001}TiHₓ, <2 11 0> α/ <011> TiHₓ) to OR1 ({0001}α//{002}TiHₓ, <2 11 0> α//<011> TiHₓ). At lower hydrogen content (≈ 0.01 wt%), the hydride nucleation is accompanied by amount of {111} stacking faults and twins. With the increased Al content, OR1 hydride is more favorable. Above 0.5 wt% H, all the hydrides exhibit OR1 with α-Ti. Meanwhile, the variant with minimum deviation from the hydride interface and grain boundary is preferably selected.

Among these, transition metal-doped gold clusters exhibits intriguing stability andelectronic properties, making them promising candidates for hydrogen related processes. In this study,we employ density functional theory (DFT) to investigate the interaction between H₂ molecules andsmall-sized gold clusters doped with yttrium. Our finding reveals that most of the bare cluster structuresremain intact during the H₂ adsorption, regardless of whether the process occurs molecularly ordissociatively. A comprehensive analysis indicates that the preferred adsorption configuration is governedby multiple factors, including adsorption site (surface vs. encapsulated), relative electronegativity, and theatomic coordination number. The calculations demonstrate that dissociative adsorption of H₂ on Au₆Yand Au₁₁Y clusters is both thermodynamically and kinetically favorable. However, for AuₙY (n = 1, 4–5, 8,10) dissociative adsorption is hindered by a significant energy barrier before reaching the final state,while for species with n = 2, 3, 7, and 9 molecular adsorption is more favorable due to intrinsic energypreferences.

The reversible hydrogen storage, investigated by pressure-composition isotherms in a Sieverts-type apparatus,arises from both the Mg-MgH₂ and the Mg₂TM-Mg₂TMHₙ transformations. Within the 0.1-20 bar and 285-320 °C window, thesamples with a 3:1 Mg/TM ratio exhibit a reversible gravimetric capacity in the 3.7-4.2 wt% range depending on TM composition,while those with a 2:1 ratio are in the 3.0-3.2 wt% range. The decreased reversible capacity compared to the initial hydrogencontent was associated with the phase segregation of the transition metals, particularly Cr and Mn, which was highlighted by X-raydiffraction and transmission electron microscopy with nanoscale microanalysis",data/pdfs/2025_Pericoli.pdf

Mg-xNi (x = 15, 20, 25 (at%)) alloys were prepared using vacuum induction melting. These alloys consisted of a primary Mg₂Ni phase and an Mg–Mg₂Ni lamellar structure, with the proportion of the primary Mg₂Ni phase increasing as the Ni content rose. The hydrogen absorption and desorption behaviors of the alloys were analyzed at 325 ◦C. The maximum hydrogen storage capacity of the Mg–15Ni alloy was 5.29 wt%. As the Ni content increased, the phase percentage of the Mg₂Ni phase increased, leading to a reduction in the maximum hydrogen storage capacities of the Mg–20Ni and Mg–25Ni alloys to 5.01 and 4.67 wt%, respectively. Although the maximum hydrogen storage capacity varied with Ni content, both the first plateau pressure (Mg → MgH₂) and the second plateau pressure (Mg₂Ni → Mg₂NiH₄) during hydrogen absorption remained unchanged and consistent across all three alloys. To understand why the plateau pressure remained constant despite variations in alloy composition, the equilibrium compositions of the Mg and Mg₂Ni phases in the alloys were calculated through thermodynamic calculations. In addition, the compositions of the Mg and Mg₂Ni phases within the lamellar structure were analyzed using transmission electron microscope. These analyses confirmed that, despite variations in Ni content across the alloys, the chemical composition of the in­ dividual Mg and Mg₂Ni phases remained unchanged. The Mg phase exhibited a 100% Mg composition, while the Mg₂Ni phase showed an atomic ratio of Mg to Ni of 2:1, closely matching the theoretical stoichiometric ratio. In hydrogen storage alloys, plateau pressures are influenced by the composition of each phase rather than the overall composition of the alloy. Consequently, even with changes in Ni content in the hyper-eutectic Mg–Ni alloys, the plateau pressures remained unchanged. When Ni is added to Mg hydrogen storage alloys, the hydrogen reaction kinetics are improved. However, this study confirmed that, despite the increase in Ni content, the plateau pressures remained unchanged, while the maximum hydrogen storage capacities decreased. There­ fore, it is essential to derive an optimal Mg–Ni alloy composition that balances both reaction kinetics and hydrogen storage capacity.",data/pdfs/2025_Cheng.pdf

The resulting alloy crystallized predominantly in the C₁₄Laves phase (92.8 wt %), with a minor body-centered cubic (BCC) phase.Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) results revealed coherentnanograin boundaries, particularly at the C₁₄/BCC interphase, facilitatingrapid hydrogenation kinetics.

Owing to the different natures (phasecompositions) of magnesium alloys and the significant number of alloying/catalytic additives used, gaps in the basic knowledge regarding the interactionof hydrogen with magnesium alloys still exist. The “solid solution case” is aquite rare example since magnesium does not have wide solid solubility regionswith many elements. However, in the Mg-Li system, only cubic Mg in Li orhexagonal Li in Mg solid solutions and their mixtures are present. Moreover,these two elements form stable ionic and ionic-covalent hydrides. In suchcases, whether the product of the hydrogenation of such solid solution-basedalloys is a mixture of basic hydrides or a mixture of hydrides with differentproperties due to interactions between them is not obvious. To answer this question, we conducted a systematic study of thehydrogenation of magnesium-lithium alloys with significantly different chemical and phase compositions. The results of ourresearch show that the kinetics of the reaction of alloys with hydrogen in the gas phase are significantly influenced by the phasecomposition of the alloys, but the final product (within the sensitivity range of our measurements) of hydrogenation is always amixture of magnesium and lithium hydrides. From such a mixture, MgH₂ can be thermally decomposed under reasonable conditions(up to 450 °C), while LiH remains stable. The thermal decomposition of the hydrogenated samples demonstrated significantdifferences in the temperatures of desorption of magnesium hydride for each sample.

When the samples were hydrogenated under 40 bar of hydrogen at 20 ◦C, the 20 h annealed sample absorbed 1.6 wt% H₂ within the longest time among the three samples. The maximum hydrogen absorption capacities of the three samples were found to be the same, exhibiting a value of 1.81 wt% H₂.

As a result, the Bi₂Ti₂O₇-catalyzed Mg/MgH₂ system lowers the hydrogen desorption initiation temperature to 194.3 °C, reduces the peak desorption temperature to245.6 °C, decreases the dehydrogenation activation energy to 82.14 kJ·mol-1, and can absorb 5.4 wt. % of hydrogen within 60 s at 200 °C,demonstrating outstanding hydrogen ab/desorption kinetics, compared to pure MgH₂.
