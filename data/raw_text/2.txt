However, the high thermodynamic stability of Mg2NiH4 poses a significant challenge in terms of the operating temperature required for hydrogen release. This study investigates the crystal and electronic structure, and thermodynamic stability of Iron-doped Mg2NiH4 and their alloys using first-principles calculations based on density functional theory. The results demonstrate that by replacing one in sixteen Mg atoms and one in eight Ni atoms with Fe, the enthalpy of hydrogen desorption can be reduced from 65.173 to 57.58 and 50.72 kJ/mol H2, respectively. Furthermore, the study clarifies the crystal structure and electron properties of Fe-doped Mg2Ni and Mg2NiH4, highlighting the significant role of weakened covalent interactions in the H–Ni bonding that contribute to the reduced thermodynamic stability of the hy­ drides. This study demonstrates that ionic conductivity improves with the destabilization of Mg2NiH4, achieving up to 5 × 91.10−1 S/cm for Mg15FeNi8H32 at 400 K. Substituting magnesium (Mg) with iron (Fe) significantly impacts the electronic structure of the material. The additional d-electrons from Fe enhance the density of electronic states near the Fermi level, leading to increased charge carrier mobility and, consequently, higher conductivity. In contrast, replacing nickel (Ni) with Fe has a less pronounced effect, as both Ni and Fe are transition metals with similar electronic configurations and d-electrons near the Fermi level. This results in fewer new electronic states and a smaller increase in conductivity compared to Mg substitution.

However, one of the primary obstacles to the reali­ zation of a hydrogen economy is efficient hydrogen storage . Solid-state hydrogen storage materials, notably lightweight metal hy­ drides which entrap hydrogen atoms within their crystal structures, have gained significant interest due to their safety and effectiveness attributes . Hydrides based on magnesium are one of the most researched groups of materials for solid-state hydrogen storage [1, 5–10]. In the literature, pure magnesium is frequently referred to as "light," although its low crystalline density (1.45 g/cm3) is an inconve­ nience since it translates to a non-spectacular volumetric density (110 kg/m3) of stored hydrogen. In practice, when the apparent density of the powder is considered, it is close to the current AB5 compounds (90–95 kg/m3). As compared to magnesium hydride , Mg2Ni-type alloy hydrides remain appealing hydrogen storage materials because to their high hydrogen capacity (3.6 wt%), light weight, and low cost [11–13]. However, due to unfavorable thermodynamics, poor hydro­ genation/dehydrogenation kinetics, and the release of unwanted by-products, the alloy materials have not found practical use . Many studies have been conducted to overcome these disadvantages and improve the characteristics of hydrogen storage by modifying the microstructure by mechanical alloying  as well as alloying with additional components [16–21]. Numerous efforts have been under­ taken to alter the enthalpy of hydrogen desorption through alloy chemistry . One of the notable examples in hydrogen storage is Mg2NiH4. This material has the capability to reversibly store 3.6 wt% of hydrogen, which is an improvement over MgH2, and its sorption kinetics are notably enhanced. However, despite these advantages, its measured hydrogen desorption enthalpy, represented by ΔHdes = 0.67 eV/H2, remains relatively high for practical applications. In the pursuit of a method to destabilize Mg2NiH4, numerous studies have been conducted to modify Mg2Ni. Yang et al.  conducted experimental research wherein Mg2Ni was alloyed with various transition metals (Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn). Their findings revealed that Ti and Cu showed the most promise as replacements for Ni in Mg2Ni. Gasiorowski’s  investigation suggested that the partial substitution of Mg with Mn or Al in Mg2Ni alloy results in an increase in discharge capacity . Liang et al.  discovered that partially substituting manganese with tita­ nium decreased the activation energy of desorption from 69 kJ/mol for nanocrystalline Mg2Ni to 59 kJ/mol for Mg1.9Ti0.1Ni. Modeling calcu­ lations using density functional theory (DFT) indicated that the enthalpy of hydrogenation for Mg2Ni could be reduced by doping with Cu, Fe, Al, Ag, Ti, and Zn. They discovered that Ti and Cu showed the most po­ tential as substitutes for Ni in Mg2Ni. Qian Li  synthesized Mg2-xAgxNi (x = 0.05, 0.1, 0.5) through hydriding combustion synthesis and concluded that incorporating a small amount of silver (Ag) into Mg2Ni is reasonable. This addition enhances the kinetics of the Mg2-xAgxNi (x = 0.05, 0.1) hydrogen storage alloy. Recently, Kalisvaart  and Chao Fan  conducted experimental studies on the hydrogen sorption properties of binary and ternary Mg-based alloys, incorporating Al, Fe, and Ti as alloying elements. They observed that the ternary alloys exhibited superior performance compared to the binary alloys. This improvement is likely attributed to the multiphase structure of the ternary alloys, where a main Mg storage phase is combined with Ti–Al or Ti–Fe intermetallic. These intermetallic phases act as pathways for enhanced hydrogen diffusion and as surface catalysts, thereby facilitating more efficient hydrogen sorption. Several theoretical studies employing first-principles calculations have been conducted to investigate doped or substituted complex hy­ drides. Van Setten  examined the impact of doping Mg2NiH4 with transition metals through first-principles density functional theory cal­ culations. The results indicated that substituting one in every eight Ni atoms with Cu or Fe can potentially reduce the hydrogen desorption enthalpy by approximately 0.1 eV/H2. Ding et al.  conducted research on the use of silicon additives as interstitial atoms in Mg2Ni through first-principles calculations. They observed that the addition of silicon atoms promotes the dehydrogenation reaction. However, the impact of silicon doping in Mg2Ni and its hydrides has received limited attention in existing studies. This study employed first-principles calculations to investigate the crystal structure, electronic structure, and thermodynamic impacts of iron doping in Mg2Ni and Mg2NiH4. This work revealed that the hydrogen desorption enthalpy could be decreased from 65.17 to 52.72 kJ/mol H2 when substituting one in sixteen magnesium atoms with Fe, and from 57.58 kJ/mol H2 when substituting one in eight nickel atoms with Fe. This suggests potential practical applications. 2. Calculation models Our calculations are performed using CASTEP is a widely used software package for performing ab initio quantum mechanical calcu­ lations on the electronic structure of materials. Developed by the Theory of Condensed Matter group at the University of Cambridge .This software utilizes plane-wave basis sets for handling valence electrons and employs pseudopotentials to approximate the potential field generated by ionic cores. The calculations utilized the Per­ dew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) generalized gradient approximation (GGA) for the exchange and correlation potential . Spin-polarized calcu­ lations were applied to Ni and Fe transition metals. To replace the core electrons, Ultrasoft pseudopotentials  in reciprocal space were utilized. All the Due to computational constraints, geometry optimiza­ tion calculations were conducted with a 380 eV energy cut-off.This level of precision is satisfactory for achieving effective convergence in both forces exerted and the total energy on the atoms  for iron-doped Mg2Ni and their hydrides. The associated k-point sets for both the pure and Fe-doped Mg2Ni unit cells are 6 × 6 × 2 and the calculations on Fe doped and undoped Mg2NiH4 unit cell utilized a 2 × 4 × 4 k-point sets. The convergence criteria were established as follows: 5.0 × 10−6 eV/atom for energy change, 5.0 × 10−4 Å for maximum displacement, 0.01 eV/Å for maximum force, 0.02 GPa for maximum stress. The activation energy for diffusion can be determined through the transition state function in CASTEP. The algorithm used by CASTEP for this pur­ pose is the "Complete LST/QST" method. This technique merges the standard LST/QST algorithm with the conjugate gradient method, facilitating a swift and dependable identification of the correct transi­ tion state . Hence, the current calculations are sufficiently ac­ curate to depict the fundamental properties of the ground states of these compounds. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Structure parameters First of all, the structure Mg2Ni and Mg2NiH4 were optimized to assess the precision of the computational models. Mg2Ni has a hexagonal structure as shown in (a), with lattice parameter a = 5.216 Å, c = 13.20 Å and space group P6222 (180) . The Mg2Ni unit cell is rep­ resented by the chemical formula Mg12Ni6, consisting of 12 magnesium atoms occupy 6i and 6f lattice sites and 6 nickel atoms occupy 3b and 3d lattices sites. The unit cell structure of Mg2NiH4, depicted in belongs to the C2/c (15) space group, housing 16 magnesium atoms, 8 nickel atoms, and 32 hydrogen atoms occupy . Structural optimization yielded the parameters for Mg2Ni and Mg2NiH4, as detailed in  and compared with experimental data. The comparison reveals a sig­ nificant degree of agreement between the computed results and exper­ imental observations, confirming the precision of the computational model utilized in this investigation. To examine the impact of doping iron in Mg2Ni and Mg2NiH4 on their structures, we replace one mag­ nesium or nickel atom with a corresponding iron atom. As depicted in Figs. 1 and 2, the unit cells of Mg2Ni and Mg2NiH4, upon doping with iron through the substitution of magnesium, are denoted as Mg11FeNi6 and Mg15FeNi8H32, respectively. Similarly, the structures Mg12FeNi5 and Mg16FeNi7H32 are obtained by replacing one nickel atom with iron I. Belkoufa et al. Materials Today Sustainability 31  101172 in the unit cells of Mg2Ni and Mg2NiH4, respectively.  presents the structural parameters of Mg12Ni6 unit cells with single iron (Fe) atom doping. It can be seen that the impact of enlarging the original lattice, caused by substituting iron (Fe) for nickel (Ni), is more pro­ nounced compared to substituting Fe for magnesium (Mg). The metallic atomic radius of Mg, Fe and Ni are 1.6, 1.26 and 1.24 respectively. The electronegativity of Fe (1.83) surpasses that of Mg (1.31) but fall short that Ni (1.91) implying a stronger interaction between Ni and Fe atoms compared to Mg and Fe atoms. This is because the atomic radii of Fe are smaller than Mg but larger than Ni, resulting in higher electronegativ­ ities for Fe compared to Mg but lower than Ni. Consequently, the crystal constants of Mg2Ni expand or contract to varying degrees when .

Belkoufa et al. Materials Today Sustainability 31  101172 substituted with Fe due to the aforementioned factors. The substitution of both Mg and Ni with Fe in Mg2NiH4 without any change in lattice parameters can be explained by forming a solid solution with both Mg and Ni, allowing it to substitute for these atoms without causing major changes in the crystal structure. 3.2. Enthalpy of formation and decomposition temperature of Fe-doped Mg2Ni and their hydrides The enthalpy of formation of a compound is established by sub­ tracting the energies of its constituent elements in their stable configu­ rations from its total energy. This measurement serves as an indication of the thermodynamic preference and degree to which the compound structure is favored compared to its individual elements. Thus, for a lattice composed of x magnesium (Mg) atoms, y iron (Fe) atoms, and z nickel (Ni) atoms, the enthalpy of formation is expressed as follows: ΔfH ( MgxFeyNiz ( MgxFeyNiz ) −[x E(Mg) + y E(Fe) + z E(Ni)] (1) In this context, Etot and Δf H stand for the total energy and formation enthalpy of the compound. Meanwhile, E(Mg), E(Fe), and E(Ni) refer to the specific atomic energies of hcp-Mg, α-Fe, and fcc-Ni in their solid states, respectively. Similarly, hydrogenation reaction for iron doped Mg11FeNi6 and Mg12Ni5Fe are: 1 12 M12N6 + H2 = 1 16Mg16Ni8H32 (2) Referred to the equation : Mg2Ni + 2H2 = Mg2NiH4 (3) Thus, the enthalpy of hydrogenation can be computed using the formula: ΔfH ( Mg16Ni8H32 ) = 1 16 Etot ( Mg16Ni8H32 ) − [ 1 12 E(Mg12Ni6) + E(H2) ] In this case, the corresponding formation reaction for hydride substi­ tution Mg11FeNi6 and Mg12FeNi5 with iron (Fe) is: 1 12Mg11FeNi6 + 1 12 Mg + 11 12 Fe + H2 = 1 16Mg15FeNi8H32 + 1 16 Mg + 15 16 Fe 1 12Mg12FeNi5 + 1 12 Ni + 11 12 Fe + H2 = 1 16Mg16FeNi7H32 + 1 16 Ni + 15 16 Fe And the variation of enthalpy of the reactions involving Fe substitution in Mg15FeNi8H32 and Mg16FeNi7H32 can be determined using the following equation: ΔfH ( Mg15FeNi8H32 ) = 1 16 Etot ( Mg15FeNi8H32 ) − 1 12 E(Mg11FeNi6) −E(H2) − 1 48 E(Mg) + 1 48 E(Fe) (6) ΔfH ( Mg16FeNi7H32 ) = 1 16 Etot ( Mg16FeNi7H32 ) − 1 12 E(Mg12FeNi5) −E(H2) − 1 48 E(Ni) + 1 48 E(Fe) (7) The total energies of compounds, such as Mg12Ni6, Mg16Ni8H32, Mg11FeMg(6f)Ni6, Mg11FeMg(6i)Ni6, Mg12FeNi(3b)Ni5, Mg12FeNi(3b)Ni5, Mg15FeNi8H32, Mg16FeNi7H32, as well as individual elements Mg, Ni, Fe, and H2, were computed and are presented in  and illustrated in . It is apparent that the formation enthalpy of Mg2Ni is −3.5792 eV. This enthalpy of formation has the most negative value indicating that it is more stable and become instable when doping Fe in Ni(3d), Ni (3b), Mg(6i) and Mg(6f) positions with ΔfH were −2.2607 eV, −2.1801 eV, −2.1475 eV, and −1.9527 eV respectively. The current computation of enthalpy of formation indicates that pure Mg2Ni phase exhibit greater thermodynamic favorability compared to the Fe-doped phases. Conse­ quently, the calculated enthalpy of formation affirms that the most favorable location for the substitution of Fe within the Mg2Ni lattice is at the Ni(3d) position. Similarly, with regards to doped Mg2NiH4, with an enthalpy of formation equal to −0,6754 eV. This can be translated to . Unit cell of Monoclinic Mg2NiH4 (a), Mg15FeNi8H32 (b), Mg16FeNi7H32 (c).

Belkoufa et al. Materials Today Sustainability 31  101172 −65.1704 kJ/mol H2, which is in a good agreement with experimental calculation of −64.3 kJ/mol referred in Ref. . A notable discovery is that Fe doping leads to a significant reduction in the reaction enthalpy with doping Mg, reaching −50.72 kJ/mol H2 for Mg15FeNi8H32 and the reaction enthalpy with doping Ni, reaching −57.58 kJ/mol H2 for Mg16FeNi7H32. In contrast to the doping of transition metal elements as previously reported, such as −51.56 kJ/mol H2 for Al, −53.63 kJ/mol H2 for Ag , −51.93 kJ/mol H2 for Mg2Ni0.875Zn0.125H4  and −46.2 kJ/mol H2 for Mg16Ni7SiH32 . This can be explained by the destability of the alloys and the Mg15FeNi8H32 hydride. To summarize, we can conclude that substituting some Mg with Fe in a specific site positively affects the dehydrogenation properties of Mg2NiH4 hydride, which strongly supports earlier experimental observations  and theoretical predictions . The second crucial parameter determined after the formation enthalpy is the decomposition temperature (Td), which is vital for choosing suitable hydrogen storage materials . The decom­ position temperature was calculated using Van’t Hoff’s law (Equation (8)) as follows: ΔG = ΔH −TΔS (8) At equilibrium, the standard Gibbs energy is assumed to be negli­ gible, and the entropy primarily arises from the release of hydrogen gas, with a value of ΔS(H2) = 130 J/mol.K. Therefore, the following equation will be employed to calculate the decomposition temperature  (equation (9)): The decomposition temperature of undoped Mg2NiH4 is therefore 501.3108 K which aligns well with the recent studies indicate that Mg2NiH4 undergoes dehydrogenation at temperatures around 503–578 K [49–51], but this value still exceeds the operational temperature range for PEM fuel cells, which spans from 289 K to 393 K . To enhance the temperature of decomposition, we substituted Fe with Mg and Ni as we did with the formation enthalpy.  and  summarized the variation of Td in different site of substitution. We can conclude that substituting Fe with Mg specifically in the 6i site greatly reduces the decomposition temperature and significantly affects stabil­ ity as the decomposition temperature approaches the operating tem­ perature of PEM fuel cells closely. 3.3. Density of state (DOS) In order to elucidate the bonding interactions in Fe doping alloys and hydrides and comprehend their stability and dehydrogenation charac­ teristics, we calculate and compare the total (DOS) and partial density of states (PDOS) per atom for both undoped and doped compounds, as depicted in Figs. 4 and 5. The computed total density of states (TDOS) for Mg2Ni and Mg2NiH4 closely aligns with findings from prior studies [43,53–55,63]. In these figures, the Fermi level (EF) is designated as zero and serves as a point of reference.  represent the Total and partial density of state of pure Mg2Ni with no band gap that indicate a metallic behavior.

Materials Today Sustainability 31  101172 energy range of −7.68eV to the Fermi level (EF). At −1.66 eV, the highest peak, primarily arises from the Ni d electrons, accompanied by contributions from the Mg s, Mg p, and a small fraction of Ni p electrons. The bonding peaks spanning from −6.32 eV to −3.47 eV originate from the combined effects of Mg (s), Mg(p), Ni(s), and Ni(p) orbitals. Addi­ tionally, the bonding peaks from −7.6 eV to −6.32 eV are predomi­ nantly governed by Mg(s) electrons, with a minor contribution from Ni (s) electrons. These findings suggest extensive hybridization between Mg and Ni atomic orbitals, with the strong bonding interactions between Mg(s), Mg(p), and Ni(d) electrons playing a dominant role in controlling the structural stability of the Mg2Ni phase. The density of states (DOS) for Mg11FeMg(6f)Ni6 and Mg11FeMg(6i)Ni6 exhibits a close resemblance, mirroring the minimal difference in their calculated enthalpies of for­ mation, as discussed earlier. Similarly, the DOS for Mg12FeNi(3b)Ni5 and Mg12FeNi(3b)Ni5 also demonstrates a comparable pattern. For Fe-doped Mg2Ni unit cells, differences in the density of states (DOS) depicted in , c, d, e, and f are noticeable. (1) In comparison to the pure Mg2Ni unit cell, the height of bonding peaks involving Mg(s), Mg(p), and Ni(d) decreases between −4.0 eV and the Fermi level (EF) for Mg11FeMg(6f)Ni6, Mg11FeMg(6i)Ni6, Mg12FeNi(3b)Ni5, and Mg12FeNi(3d)Ni5. (2) As a result of Fe substitution, the Fe s, Fe p, and Fe d orbitals engage in bonding with Ni and Mg atomic orbitals within the energy range of −4.0 to EF (0 eV). The first observation suggests a weakening of the interaction among Mg s, Mg p, and Ni d orbitals, leading to the destabilization of the unit cells. The primary interaction between Mg and Ni atoms remains the most signifi­ cant, as it upholds the structural integrity of the unit cell. Therefore, despite the bonding among Mg, Ni, and Fe atoms, the reduction in Mg–Ni atomic interaction diminishes the stability of Fe-doped phases, aligning with the calculated enthalpy of for­ mation results.  shows the density of state of undoped Mg2NiH4 which exhibits two distinct energy gaps: a fundamental gap and a valence gap, situated between the Fermi level (EF) and .

Materials Today Sustainability 31  101172 1.34eV, −2.66eV, and −3.34ev, respectively. The bonding peaks spanning from the Fermi level (EF) to −2.66 eV primarily stem from the contributions of valence electrons from Ni(3d), H(s), and a small fraction of Mg(3s) (2p) orbitals. Between −3.34 and −6 eV, the bonding peaks result from interactions between H(s) and Ni(3d), as well as a few Mg(3s) (2p) electrons. Furthermore, the bonding peaks observed between −6 and −9 eV are mainly governed by the valence electrons of H(s), Ni(4s), and a few Mg (3s) orbitals. Clearly, there exists a significant hybridization be­ tween Ni(3d) (4s) and H(s) orbitals compared to that between Mg (3s) (2p) and H(s) orbitals, indicating that the Ni–H bonding interaction is stronger than that of Mg–H in Mg2NiH4 hydride. The outcomes align with other computational investigations . Following Fe doping, as depicted in (b) and (c), the density of states (DOS) and partial density of states (pDOS) plots shift towards lower energy levels compared to the undoped case. When Fe is introduced as a dopant in Mg, it decreased the direct gap significantly and adds extra states within both the funda­ mental and valence energy gaps. This phenomenon leads to the reduction or elimination of these energy gaps. In other words, the introduction of Fe in Mg disrupts the existing energy band structure of the material, causing the energy gaps to narrow or vanish altogether. This effect is significant as it alters the elec­ tronic properties of the material, potentially influencing its behavior and performance in various applications. Hence, the destabilization of Mg2NiH4 due to Fe doping can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, the interactions between Mg and Ni (Mg–Ni) and between Ni and H (Ni–H) are weakened by the introduction of Fe. Secondly, there is a decrease in the number of bonding electrons below the Fermi level (EF) as a result of Fe doping. Hence, the introduction of doping may decrease the stability of the hydride system. This outcome aligns with the calculated enthalpies of formation. These factors are intrinsic to the system and contribute to the enhancement of the dehydro­ genation properties of Mg2NiH4 hydride. 3.4. Ionic conductivity The ionic conductivity of metal hydrides is crucial for hydrogen storage, as it impacts the efficiency of hydrogen absorption and desorption. Enhanced ionic conductivity improves hydrogen diffusion and kinetics, which is vital for applications requiring rapid cycling and high efficiency, such us PEM fuel cells. Research focuses on optimizing material properties to enhance storage capacity and performance, with factors such as temperature, pressure, and alloying elements signifi­ cantly influencing ionic conductivity and overall system efficiency. Understanding these factors is essential for developing advanced hydrogen storage materials for modern energy applications [56–59]. The ionic conductivity (σ) of pure and doped Mg2NiH4 hydride can be calculated using the following equation: .

Materials Today Sustainability 31  101172 kTm nEaτ0 exp [−Ea τ0 = I v (11) ̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅ 2 × Ea Where the constants are tabulated in Nomenclature table and I is equal to 2.46 ˚A,. The diffusion activation energies are shown in . As illustrated, the activation energy decreases from 0.53 eV for Mg12Ni8H32 to 0.49 eV for Mg12FeNi7H32 and further to 0.44 eV for Mg15FeNiH32. This reduction in activation energy is attributed to the variation in distance between neighboring sites. The ionic conductivity calculated using equation (10) and illustrated in  shows that σ is also influ­ enced by the substitution of Mg and Ni with Fe. In our system, the ionic conductivity of pure Mg2NiH4 is 3.84 × 10−4 S/cm at room temperature (300K), which agrees with experimental results . The comparison of ln(σ) versus 103/T in  demonstrates a strong agreement between theoretical and experimental data. The similar slopes confirm that the activation energies for ionic conductivity are effectively captured by the theoretical model, affirming its reliability. This concordance reinforces the validity of the theoretical approach and supports its use in analyzing and predicting ionic conductivity in hydrogen storage materials. In contrast, the ionic conductivity of Mg16FeNi7H32 and Mg15FeNi8H32 is 8.16 × 10−4 S/cm and 1.1910−3 S/ cm, at room temperature respectively. This demonstrates that the ionic conductivity increases with the destabilization of the material, reaching up to 1.12 × 10−1 S/cm for Mg15FeNi8H32 at 400K. The slight deviation in absolute conductivity values particularly the offset observed in the vertical scale is attributed primarily to intrinsic limitations in the idealized assumptions of the model, such as perfect crystallinity, absence of grain boundaries, and neglect of defect-related scattering mechanisms, all of which can impact carrier mobility in real samples. Additionally, environmental variables such as pressure, microstructure, and sample purity in experimental setups may further contribute to the observed offset. When iron (Fe) substitutes magnesium (Mg) in the Mg2NiH4 lattice, the introduced 3d electrons from Fe contribute significantly to the conduction band, modifying the electronic structure. Magnesium, an alkaline earth metal, primarily supplies s-electrons that lie far below the Fermi level and play a limited role in electrical conduction. In contrast, Fe introduces localized 3d states near the Fermi level, thereby increasing the density of states (DOS) in this region. This enhanced DOS facilitates greater charge carrier availability and improved electronic interactions, ultimately contributing to higher ionic conductivity. Furthermore, the Fe 3d orbitals exhibit stronger hybridization with neighboring s and p orbitals, promoting better charge transport and lowering the activation energy required for ionic migration. In comparison, when Fe replaces nickel (Ni), the effect on conduc­ tivity is less pronounced. Both Fe and Ni are transition metals with similar 3d electron configurations, and Ni already contributes d- . H diffusion activation energy diagram (a).

Consequently, Fe-for-Ni substitution results in minimal modifications to the DOS and conduction band, leading to only a modest improvement in ionic conductivity. Overall, changes in the electronic density and orbital hybridization introduced by Fe, particularly when substituting Mg facilitate more efficient ionic transport by reducing the migration barrier. These effects underscore the potential of Fe-doped Mg2NiH4 as a promising candidate for advanced hydrogen storage applications, where enhanced ionic conductivity is critical for high-performance operation. 4. Conclusions Utilizing the first-principles calculations method grounded in density functional theory (DFT) with CASTEP software, an in-depth investiga­ tion into the dehydrogenation properties and underlying micro mecha­ nism of Fe-doped Mg2Ni and their hydride Mg2NiH4 is systematically conducted. The principal conclusions are outlined as follow: 1 The computed lattice parameters and atomic coordinates closely match experimental findings. The enthalpy of formation calculations indicate that the pure Mg2Ni phase is thermodynamically more favorable than the Fe-doped phases. Furthermore, the potential sites for Fe substitution within the Mg2Ni lattice have been identified, with confirmed preferences in the following order: Mg(6f) < Mg(6i) < Ni(3b) < Ni(3d) positions. 2 The substitution of Fe diminishes the stability of Mg2NiH4, as evi­ denced by the decrease information enthalpy. However, in compar­ ison, the enhancement in dehydrogenation performance due to doping Fe with Mg substitution is superior to that of Ni. 3 Analysis of the density of states (DOS) suggests that the predominant factor governing the structural stability of both pure and Fe-doped Mg2Ni phases is the strong hybridization between Mg s, Mg p, and Ni d electrons. However, the substitution of Fe for Mg and Ni atoms in the Mg2Ni unit cell weakens the interaction between Mg s, Mg p, and Ni d electrons. However, the destabilization of Fe doped Mg2NiH4 is more favorable when doping Mg than Ni. The findings from the analysis of the density of states (DOS) align with those obtained from the calculation of enthalpies of formation. 4 The ionic conductivity of Mg2NiH4 increases significantly with Fe substitution, rising from 4.81 × 10−2 S/cm to 1.12 × 10−1 S/cm at 400 K. Fe substitution for Mg introduces additional d-electrons, enhancing charge carrier mobility, while Fe doping in Ni has a smaller effect due to similar electronic configurations. Theoretical and experimental results show good agreement in terms of temperature-dependent conductivity.
