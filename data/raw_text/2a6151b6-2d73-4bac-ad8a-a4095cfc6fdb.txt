Abstract 
The role of catalysts in enhancing the hydrogen storage kinetics of the Mg/MgH2 system is pivotal. However, the exploration of efﬁcient 
catalysts and the underlying principles of their design remain both a prominent focus and a signiﬁcant challenge in current research. In 
this study, we present a bimetallic oxide of Bi2 Ti2 O7 hollow sphere as a highly effective catalyst for MgH2 . As a result, the Bi2 Ti2 O7 - 
catalyzed Mg/MgH2 system lowers the hydrogen desorption initiation temperature to 194.3 °C, reduces the peak desorption temperature to 
245.6 °C, decreases the dehydrogenation activation energy to 82.14 kJ ·mol−1 , and can absorb 5.4 wt. % of hydrogen within 60 s at 200 °C, 
demonstrating outstanding hydrogen ab/desorption kinetics, compared to pure MgH2 . Additionally, it can maintain a high hydrogen capacity 
of 5.2 wt. %, even after 50 dehydrogenation cycles, showing good cycle stability. The characterization results show that the high-valent Bi 
and Ti in Bi2 Ti2 O7 are reduced to their low-valent or even zero-valent metallic states during the dehydrogenation and hydrogenation process, 
thus establishing an in-situ multivalent and multi-element catalytic environment. Density functional theory calculations further reveal that the 
synergistic effects between Bi and Ti in the Bi-Ti mixed oxide facilitate the cleavage of Mg-H bonds and lower the kinetic barrier for the 
dissociation of hydrogen molecules, thereby substantially enhancing the kinetics of the Mg/MgH2 system. This study presents a strategic 
method for developing efﬁcient catalysts for hydrogen storage materials by harnessing the synergistic effects of metal elements.

1. Introduction 
Energy serves as a fundamental material cornerstone for 
the survival and advancement of human society. As global 
progress accelerates and living standards continue to rise, the 
escalating energy demand coupled with the gradual depletion 
of fossil fuels presents an urgent and profound challenge that 
the world must confront [1–5] . In order to meet future en- 
ergy demands, particularly in the transportation sector, which

accounts for nearly 60 % of global energy consumption, there 
is an immediate need to identify green, efﬁcient alternatives 
to traditional fossil fuels [6–10] . Among the various poten- 
tial sources of alternative energy, hydrogen stands out as a 
premier option, owing to its superior energy density, environ- 
mental benignity, and abundant availability. However, hydro- 
gen storage limits its utilization of hydrogen energy. Various 
approaches for hydrogen storage have been explored, with 
solid-state hydrogen storage emerging as the predominant fo- 
cus due to its high gravimetric hydrogen density, superior 
safety characteristics, and cost-effectiveness. 
Magnesium hydride (MgH2 ), known for its high theoreti- 
cal mass capacity (7.6 wt. %), high security, exceptional re- 
versibility, cost-effectiveness, and non-toxicity, has emerged 
as a promising option for solid-state hydrogen storage mate-

rials [11–14] . However, the thermodynamic stability and slow 
kinetic of the Mg/MgH2 system require high temperatures, 
signiﬁcantly hindering its practical application [15–19] . In re- 
cent years, ongoing advancements in the study of magnesium- 
based hydrogen storage materials have led to signiﬁcant im- 
provements in their hydrogen absorption and desorption per- 
formance [20–22] . So far, signiﬁcant efforts have been ded- 
icated to developing highly efﬁcient catalysts and gaining a 
deeper understanding of their catalytic mechanisms, such as 
additive modiﬁcation, [23] alloying, [24] and nano structuring 
[25–26] . 
Among these approaches, the incorporation of catalysts 
into MgH2 to enhance hydrogen storage properties remains 
the most widely adopted due to its simplicity and effec- 
tiveness. Catalyst research to date has largely concentrated 
on a range of transition metals, such as nickel, cobalt, ti- 
tanium, niobium, vanadium, molybdenum, and their com- 
pounds. Among these, Ti-based catalysts have demonstrated 
relatively high catalytic activity. For instance, Liang et al. 
[27] compared the catalytic performance of metals such as 
titanium, vanadium, manganese, nickel, and iron, and estab- 
lished the following sequence of catalytic activity for hydro- 
genation Mg-based hydrogen storage materials: Ti > V > 
Fe > Mn > Ni. Han et al. [28] employed ﬁrst-principles 
calculations to show that Ti doping weakens the ionic in- 
teraction between Mg-H, which not only reduces the micro- 
scopic energy required for hydrogen atom removal but also 
lowers the macroscopic hydrogen desorption temperature. Al- 
though the catalytic performance of Ti has been extensively 
studied, single Ti-based catalysts still fail to meet the applica- 
tion demands of the Mg/MgH2 system, necessitating further 
enhancement of their catalytic activity. Recent studies have 
demonstrated that the synergistic effects between two metal 
elements in bimetallic oxides can signiﬁcantly improve the 
catalytic performance of various reactions. This synergy is 
also applicable to the catalysis of hydrogen storage materi- 
als based on magnesium materials and remains an active area 
of exploration. For example, Xian et al. [29] synthesized a 
two-dimensional Ti-Nb oxide nanosheet, TiNb2 O7 , which was 
incorporated into MgH2 via ball milling. The observed reduc- 
tion in the hydrogen desorption onset temperature of MgH2 
to 178 °C upon the incorporation of 3 wt. % catalysts can 
be ascribed to the combined catalytic effect between the two 
metal elements, resulting in a substantial 100 °C decrease 
compared to pure MgH2 . Moreover, unique structures that 
may form during the catalyst preparation process have the 
potential to further enhance catalytic performance to some 
extent. Zhang et al. [4] employed a hydrothermal synthesis 
method to produce o-Nb2 O5 , resulting in a distinctive hollow 
morphology with porous structures. Their ﬁndings demon- 
strated that the incorporation of 7 wt. % o-Nb2 O5 notably low- 
ered the initial dehydrogenation temperature of MgH2 from 
260 °C to a range between 250 °C and 195 °C. At 300 °C, 
the MgH2 composite containing o-Nb2 O5 rapidly desorbed 
over 5.5 wt. % H2 , and at 200 °C, it efﬁciently re-absorbed 
5 wt. % of hydrogen within 30 s. The author proposed that 
the unique structural characteristics of the o-Nb2 O5 were in- 
strumental in facilitating these enhanced hydrogenation and 
dehydrogenation behaviors. In addition, the hydrogen diffu- 
sion rate in magnesium-based alloys is markedly higher than 
that in pure MgH2 . Consequently, the introduction of alloy- 
ing elements to form multicomponent alloys or intermetal- 
lic compounds emerges as a potent strategy to improve both 
the kinetics and thermodynamics of the MgH2 system. Chen 
et al. [8] introduced an efﬁcient alloy catalyst for MgH2 par- 
ticles, comprising low-activity elements Mo and Ni (MoNi 
alloy). The in-situ generated MoNi and Mg2 Ni nanoparticles 
tightly and uniformly encapsulate the MgH2 core, establish- 
ing extensive interfaces that facilitate both hydrogen reaction 
sites and diffusion pathways. The MoNi-catalyzed Mg/MgH2 
system demonstrated a remarkable hydrogen absorption and 
release capacity of 6.7 wt. % at 300 °C, with hydrogen ab- 
sorption occurring within 60 s and desorption within 10 min. 
This system exhibited exceptional cyclic stability and supe- 
rior low-temperature hydrogen storage performance. These 
advancements provide signiﬁcant impetus for further inves- 
tigations into harnessing the synergistic interactions between 
metal elements to develop high-performance bimetallic cata- 
lysts [30–34] . 
Despite considerable advances in enhancing the hydrogen 
storage performance of MgH2 , its properties still fall short of 
meeting the practical demands for solid-state hydrogen stor- 
age applications [18 , 35–36] . In this work, the innovative hol- 
low microsphere structure of the Bi2 Ti2 O7 catalyst is pre- 
sented, which substantially enhances the hydrogen desorption 
and absorption processes of the Mg/MgH2 system. The ad- 
dition of only 10 wt. % Bi2 Ti2 O7 hollow spheres reduces the 
MgH2 desorption peak temperature to 245.6 °C, lowering the 
activation energy for dehydrogenation to 82.14 kJ ·mol−1 —an 
approximately 43 % reduction compared to pure MgH2 . The 
investigation into the synergistic effects between elements re- 
veals their signiﬁcant impact on the hydrogen storage capabil- 
ities of the Mg/MgH2 system. DFT calculations demonstrate 
that the alloying of Bi with Mg modulates the hydrogen bind- 
ing free energy at the surface by altering the D -band electron 
density, thereby enabling the Bi2 Mg3 alloy to exhibit superior 
hydrogen adsorption and desorption properties. Additionally, 
through the hydrogen uptake and release processes, the in-situ 
synthesis of TiO2 and other multivalent Ti species not only 
promotes extensive interactions between catalytic active sites 
and MgH2 but also offers notable advantages in facilitating 
rapid electron transfer and the diffusion of hydrogen atoms or 
molecules. These attributes underscore the synergistic interac- 
tion between Bi and Ti, positioning Bi2 Ti2 O7 as a promising 
catalyst for the Mg/MgH2 system. This work provides a new 
highly effective bimetallic oxide as a catalyst for MgH2 , and 
the proposed mechanism underlying its catalytic action.

tion of the preparation process. In the synthesis process, 
Mg (99.8 %, Macklin), Bi(NO3 )3 ·5H2 O (99.0 %, Macklin), 
Ti(OC4 H9 )4 (99 %, Aladdin), and acetone (99 %, SCRC) were 
utilized. All chemicals were of analytical reagent grade and 
did not require further puriﬁcation. Bi2 Ti2 O7 microspheres 
were fabricated through a simple solvothermal method, em- 
ploying bismuth nitrate (Bi(NO3 )3 ·5H2 O) and Ti(OC4 H9 )4 as 
the precursor materials. Bi(NO3 )3 ·5H2 O (1 mmol) was dis- 
solved in 20 mL of acetone solution, to which 1 mmol of 
TBOT was gradually added under vigorous stirring. The mix- 
ture was agitated for 2 h and treated with ultrasound for 
15 min, after which the solution was transferred into a 50 mL 
Teﬂon-lined stainless autoclave and maintained at 120 °C for 
12 h. The product was then ﬁltered three times using an- 
hydrous ethanol and deionized water, it was oven-dried at 
60 °C for 2 h and then heated in air at 600 °C for 3 h. The 
calcined material was subsequently ground into a ﬁne, uni- 
form powder, yielding Bi2 Ti2 O7 microspheres. For compar- 
ative analysis, Bi2 O3 and TiO2 were synthesized by adding 
only Bi(NO3 )3 ·5H2 O or Ti(OC4 H9 )4 , respectively, during the 
preparation process, employing the control-variable approach. 
2.2. Preparation of MgH2 -x wt. % Bi2 Ti2 O7 ( x = 6, 8, 10, 
12) composites 
MgH2 was prepared independently by calcination in the 
laboratory. The MgH2 –10 wt. % Bi2 Ti2 O7 composite was fab- 
ricated through high-energy ball milling. A mixture of 0.03 g 
of Bi2 Ti2 O7 and 0.27 g of MgH2 was placed in the milling 
jar, with a ball-to-material ratio of 60:1. The milling process 
was carried out within an argon-ﬁlled glove box. Milling was 
conducted at a rotational speed of 400 rpm for 6 h, employing 
a program that alternated between 24 min of operation and 
6 min of rest. The resulting product was designated MgH2 –
10 wt. % Bi2 Ti2 O7 . Similarly, MgH2 composites with varying 
Bi2 Ti2 O7 contents ( x = 6, 8, 12 wt. %) were prepared under 
the same milling conditions for comparative analysis. 
2.3. Characterization and hydrogen storage performance 
tests 
The phase composition of the samples was assessed us- 
ing an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Empyrean from Malvern 
Panalytical) under an inert nitrogen atmosphere in an anaer- 
obic glove box, employing a step size of 2 θ = 0.02 ° and a 
scan speed of 10 °/min. The X-ray source used was Cu-K α
radiation with a wavelength of 0.15406 ˚A. The microstruc- 
tural characterization and lattice analysis of the samples were 
conducted using ﬁeld emission scanning electron microscopy 
(FESEM, AMBER GMH from TESCAN) and transmission 
electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-F200 from Electron). El- 
emental distribution was mapped using TEM coupled with 
energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS, Super-X). Surface com- 
position and elemental valence states were analyzed via X-

ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCALAB Xi + from 
Thermo Scientiﬁc). Hydrogen storage performance was eval- 
uated using a custom Sievert-type apparatus, following the 
volume method. In the temperature-programmed desorption 
test (TPD), the reactor was evacuated to 0.0001 MPa, and the 
sample was heated to 450 °C at a heating rate of 5 °C ·min−1 . 
During the non-isothermal hydrogenation process, the sample 
was exposed to 3 MPa H2 and heating rate at 10 °C ·min−1 
from room temperature to 300 °C. The hydrogen release peak 
temperature of various samples was measured using a Net- 
zsch STA-449 differential scanning calorimeter (DSC). Addi- 
tionally, the pressure-composition-temperature (PCT) curve of 
the dehydrogenation process was monitored using the Sievert- 
type apparatus, with dehydrogenation cycles performed at hy- 
drogen pressures of 8 MPa and 0.0001 MPa, at 450 °C for 
desorption and 300 °C for absorption. 
2.4. Computational models and methods 
All density functional theory (DFT) calculations were 
performed using the Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package 
(VASP) [37–38] . The exchange-correlation interactions were 
modeled using the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional 
within the framework of the generalized gradient approxi- 
mation (GGA) method [39] . Core-valence interactions were 
treated using the projected augmented wave (PAW) method 
[40] . A plane-wave energy cutoff of 480 eV was applied, 
and a 3 × 3 × 1 Monkhorst-Pack k-point grid was used to 
sample the Brillouin zone. A vacuum space of 15 ˚A was in- 
troduced above the surfaces to eliminate periodic interactions. 
Structural optimization was performed using energy and force 
convergence criteria set to 1.0 × 10−4 eV and 0.02 eV ˚A−1 , 
respectively. 
3. Results and discussion 
3.1. Characterization of Bi2 Ti2 O7 catalysts 
The synthesized catalyst was thoroughly characterized, and 
phase analysis of Bi2 Ti2 O7 was performed XRD, as shown 
in Fig. 1 (b). In the XRD pattern of the composite material, 
the peaks corresponding to Bi2 Ti2 O7 at various diffraction 
peaks were in excellent agreement with the standard XRD 
card (JCPDS: PDF#32–0118). Notable diffraction peaks ap- 
peared at 14.877 °, 28.68 °, and 29.96 °, which are assigned 
to the (222), (622), and (444) planes, respectively. No addi- 
tional diffraction peaks were observed and conﬁrming that the 
synthesized material is predominantly composed of Bi2 Ti2 O7 
with high purity. 
To further elucidate the elemental valence states, XPS 
was employed on the Bi2 Ti2 O7 hollow spheres. As shown 
in Figs. 1 (c) and (d), the XPS spectrum for Bi 4f ( Fig. 1 (c)) 
displays binding energy peaks at 158.8 eV and 164.2 eV, 
corresponding to the Bi 4f7/2 and Bi 4f5/2 peaks, respec- 
tively. These features are indicative of the presence of Bi3+ 
in the octahedral structure of Bi2 Ti2 O7 , consistent with the 
expected valence state. The Ti 2p XPS spectrum ( Fig. 1 (d)) 
shows Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 peaks at 463.7 eV and 457.6 eV, 
respectively, conﬁrming that Ti is primarily in the Ti
4 + 
oxidation state on the sample surface. A broad peak near 
465.0 eV, resulting from the overlap of Ti 2p1/2 and Bi 
4d3/2 peaks, further supports this interpretation. These ﬁnd- 
ings are in agreement with previous studies. Moreover, the 
full XPS spectrum of Bi2 Ti2 O7 , together with the XPS spec- 
tra for the O and C elements, is presented in Supplemen- 
tary Fig. S1. The C 1s spectrum facilitates the correction of 
peak positions, with a reference binding energy of 248.8 eV. 
The binding energy of O 1s, approximately 528.5 eV, fur- 
ther substantiates the oxidation state of the bimetallic ox- 
ide. SEM analysis of Bi2 Ti2 O7 reveals a hollow microsphere 
structure, with the spheres adopting a clumped morphology 
( Fig. 1 (e)). Building on previous studies [5] , it is proposed 
that this hollow spherical architecture can substantially in- 
crease the material’s speciﬁc surface area, thereby enhanc- 
ing the number of active sites and, in turn, improving its 
catalytic efﬁciency. To investigate the crystalline structure, 
HRTEM was employed to measure lattice spacings in selected 
regions, as illustrated in Fig. 1 (f). The interplanar distances 
of 0.312 nm and 0.595 nm correspond to the (622) and (222) 
planes of Bi2 Ti2 O7 , respectively, which are in agreement with 
the XRD results. EDS mapping, presented in Fig. 1 (g), re- 
veals a uniform distribution of elements across the catalyst 
surface, with Bi, Ti, and O regions showing substantial over- 
lap, thereby further validating the successful synthesis of 
Bi2 Ti2 O7 . 
For comparison purposes, XRD analysis was also per- 
formed on samples containing only Bi2 O3 and TiO2 , as shown 
in Fig. S2. The diffraction peaks from the Bi-only sample 
were identiﬁed as Bi2 O3 , exhibiting a strong match with the 
standard XRD card (JCPDS no.32–0118). Similarly, the Ti- 
only sample displayed diffraction peaks consistent with TiO2 , 
which also matched the standard XRD card (JCPDS no.32–
0118). Fig. S3(a–d) illustrates the SEM images of the sam- 
ples, offering a comprehensive comparison of their morpho- 
logical characteristics. Bi2 O3 displays an irregular, rod-like 
structure, while TiO2 is manifested as ﬁne particulate aggre- 
gates. The distinctive morphology of the Bi2 Ti2 O7 bimetallic 
oxide is likely to have played a signiﬁcant role in enhancing 
its hydrogen storage performance. 
3.2. Characterization of MgH2 –10 wt. % Bi2 Ti2 O7 
composites 
Fig. 2 (a) displays the XRD patterns of the Bi2 Ti2 O7 cat- 
alyst before and after ball milling with MgH2 . In the XRD 
pattern of the MgH2 –10 wt. % Bi2 Ti2 O7 composite post-ball 
milling, characteristic peaks of MgH2 appear at 27.946 °, 
35.743 °, 39.855 °, and 54.616 °, corresponding to the (110), 
(101), (200), and (211) planes, respectively. The diffraction 
peaks of Bi2 Ti2 O7 in the composite are observed at 14.877 °, 
28.68 °, and 29.96 °, corresponding to the (222), (622), and 
(444) planes, respectively, conﬁrming the thorough mixing 
of the two materials. Additionally, ball milling induces a 
partial reaction between Bi2 Ti2 O7 and MgH2 , resulting in

Diffraction peaks observed at 23.966 ° and 25.063 ° corre- 
spond to the (002) and (101) planes of Bi2 Mg3 . Nonethe- 
less, MgH2 and Bi2 Ti2 O7 remain the dominant phases. The 
milling process effectively reduces the particle size of both 
MgH2 and Bi2 Ti2 O7 . The TEM image in Fig. 2 (b) reveals 
dark spots, which are tentatively identiﬁed as the Bi2 Mg3 
alloy formed during milling. As shown in Fig. 2 (c), lattice 
spacing measurements from selected regions yield values of 
d = 0.258 nm, 0.159 nm, 0.234 nm, corresponding to the 
(800) plane of Bi2 Ti2 O7 , the (220) plane of MgH2 , and the 
(110) plane of Bi2 Mg3 , respectively. Furthermore, the SAED 
rings shown in Fig. 2 (d) correspond to the (800) plane of 
Bi2 Ti2 O7 , the (220) plane of MgH2 , and the (110) plane of 
Bi2 Mg3 , further validating the presence of these three phases 
in the composite material. The increased number of crystal 
planes facilitates the destabilization of MgH2 , enhancing its 
propensity for hydrogen release. Moreover, the distribution of 
MgH2 , Bi2 Mg3 , and Bi2 Ti2 O7 is discernible through EDS el- 
emental mapping ( Fig. 2 (e)). The overlapping regions of Mg 
and Bi enrichments correspond to Bi2 Ti2 O7 , while the par- 
tial overlap of the Mg and Bi enrichments corresponds to 
the Bi2 Mg3 alloy. The EDS mapping conﬁrms the uniform 
distribution of the elements within the composite material 
( Fig. 2 (e)).

To assess the synergistic effect of the Bi-Ti bimetallic cata- 
lyst, the dehydrogenation performance of the MgH2 –10 wt. % 
Bi2 Ti2 O7 composite was compared to that of control sam- 
ples. As shown in Fig. 3 (a), under identical catalyst load- 
ing conditions, the MgH2 –10 wt. % Bi2 Ti2 O7 composite ex- 
hibits the lowest hydrogen desorption temperature and the 
most rapid dehydrogenation kinetics. For the composite ma- 
terial doped with 10 wt. % TiO2 , the initial desorption temper-

ature is reduced to 220 °C, representing a notable improve- 
ment over pure MgH2 ; however, it remains higher than that 
of the MgH2 –10 wt. % Bi2 Ti2 O7 composite. Surprisingly, the 
incorporation of Bi2 O3 did not lead to a signiﬁcant enhance- 
ment in the dehydrogenation performance of MgH2 . While 
a modest reduction in the initial desorption temperature was 
observed, decreasing from 337 °C to 321.3 °C, the peak des- 
orption temperature remained similar to that of pure MgH2 . 
Furthermore, the overall hydrogen release was even lower, 
dropping from approximately 7.5 wt. % to 6.3 wt. %, thus un- 
derscoring the absence of any appreciable catalytic activity. 
To elucidate the catalytic role of Ti species, XRD character- 
ization was performed on both MgH2 -Bi2 Ti2 O7 and MgH2 - 
Bi2 O3 composites in their as-milled state and after initial de- 
hydrogenation. Fig. S4(a) reveals that no Bi2 Mg3 alloy phase 
formed in the MgH2 -Bi2 O3 composite after ball-milling, re- 
sulting in a lack of catalytic active sites during initial dehy- 
drogenation. Fig. S4(b) shows that there is a distinct Bi2 Mg3 
alloy phase in the composite material after dehydrogenation. 
From this, it can be inferred that the Bi2 Mg3 alloy phase is 
more likely to form under high-temperature conditions, and 
the presence of Ti4 + in Bi2 Ti2 O7 accelerates this process. 
These ﬁndings underscore the indispensable role of multiva- 
lent metal oxides in the catalytic modiﬁcation of MgH2 , par- 
ticularly highlighting the advantages of Ti-containing catalysts 
in maintaining reversible redox cycles and stable catalytic 
interfaces. 
To further explore the catalytic role of the hollow-sphere 
Bi2 Ti2 O7 bimetallic oxide in improving the hydrogen stor- 
age performance of MgH2 , the dehydrogenation performance 
of ball-milled composites containing varying amounts of 
Bi2 Ti2 O7 (MgH2 -x wt. % Bi2 Ti2 O7 ) was investigated, as 
shown in Fig. 3 (b). Pure MgH2 exhibited a high initial desorp- 
tion temperature of 335 °C. The comparison of dehydrogena- 
tion performances reveals that the MgH2 –10 wt. % Bi2 Ti2 O7 
composite demonstrates the most remarkable results, exhibit- 
ing an initial desorption temperature of 194.3 °C and a ﬁnal 
hydrogen desorption of 6.59 wt. %. The difference in initial 
desorption temperature between target and control samples 
is highlighted in Fig. 3 (c). Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 
S5, compared to previously reported catalytic systems, our 
catalyst showed excellent performance at initial desorption 
temperatures, maintaining a high amount of dehydrogenation 
even at relatively low starting temperatures. Comprehensive 
comparative data of representative samples are provided in 
Table S1 of the Supporting Information [4 , 11 , 29 , 41–45] . To 
further elucidate the differences in hydrogen storage capabil- 
ities, isothermal hydrogen absorption tests were conducted at 
200 °C and 3 MPa, as depicted in Fig. 3 (d). Under the same 
conditions, the MgH2 –10 wt. % Bi2 Ti2 O7 composite reaches 
a hydrogen absorption of 5.14 wt. % within approximately 
30 min, whereas the MgH2 –10 wt. % TiO2 composite absorbs 
only 3.95 wt. % H2 . Interestingly, the MgH2 –10 wt. % Bi2 O3 
composite even shows poorer hydrogen absorption than pure 
MgH2 , suggesting that this material is almost non-recyclable. 
By observing Fig. S4(b), it was found that Bi2 O3 was almost 
completely consumed after dehydrogenation, lacking a re- 
versible electron transfer pathway. Therefore, Bi2 O3 can only 
be irreversibly reduced to Bi0 (Bi3 + → Bi0 ), which hinders the 
continuous supply of active sites in subsequent cycles and

leads to a poor hydrogen absorption effect. From the compar- 
ative hydrogen absorption and desorption data, it is evident 
that the synergistic interaction between the Bi and Ti metal 
elements within the catalyst signiﬁcantly enhances the kinetic 
properties of MgH2 [46] . 
Subsequent measurements were conducted on the isother- 
mal hydrogen absorption and desorption curves of pure MgH2 
and MgH2 –10 wt. % Bi2 Ti2 O7 composites across a range of 
temperatures. As illustrated in Fig. 3 (e), the MgH2 –10 wt. % 
Bi2 Ti2 O7 composite achieved a hydrogen desorption capac- 
ity of 6.3 wt. % within 15 min at 290 °C, whereas pure 
MgH2 showed no detectable desorption initiation under iden- 
tical conditions. Even at an elevated temperature of 350 °C, 
pure MgH2 released only 1.63 wt. % hydrogen after 20 min. 
These results demonstrate that Bi2 Ti2 O7 incorporation signif- 
icantly enhances the dehydrogenation performance of MgH2 , 
enabling higher hydrogen release yields at substantially re- 
duced temperatures. Fig. 3 (f) presents the isothermal hydro- 
gen absorption data for both pure MgH2 and MgH2 –10 wt. % 
Bi2 Ti2 O7 composites under 3 MPa pressure at various temper- 
atures. At 200 °C, the fully dehydrogenated MgH2 –10 wt. % 
Bi2 Ti2 O7 composite absorbed 5.29 wt. % H2 within 60 min, 
while pure MgH2 achieved merely 1.66 wt. % H2 absorption 
under identical conditions. These ﬁndings conclusively indi- 
cate that undoped MgH2 requires signiﬁcantly higher opera- 
tional temperatures to attain hydrogen sorption performance 
comparable to the Bi2 Ti2 O7 -modiﬁed material. In summary, 
the catalytic doping strategy developed in this study substan- 
tially enhances both hydrogen absorption and release proper- 
ties of MgH2 , presenting a promising pathway for advancing 
magnesium-based hydrogen storage materials. 
3.4. Dehydrogenation kinetics and thermodynamics 
The thermodynamic and kinetic impacts of the Bi2 Ti2 O7 
catalyst on the dehydrogenation behavior of MgH2 were fur- 
ther examined through DSC, and the Kissinger method [47] . 
Figs. 4 (a–b) present the DSC curves for both pure MgH2 
and the MgH2 –10 wt. % Bi2 Ti2 O7 composite, recorded at 
heating rates of 3 °C ·min−1 , 5 °C ·min−1 , 7 °C ·min−1 and 
10 °C ·min−1 . The DSC curve of pure MgH2 at a heating 
rate of 3 °C ·min−1 shows a dehydrogenation peak at approx- 
imately 339 °C. In contrast, when Bi2 Ti2 O7 is incorporated, 
the dehydrogenation peak for the MgH2 –10 wt. % Bi2 Ti2 O7 
composite shifts to a signiﬁcantly lower temperature. Speciﬁ- 
cally, the dehydrogenation peak temperature for this compos- 
ite drops to 245.6 °C, marking a reduction of 93.4 °C com- 
pared to pure MgH2 . This marked decrease in the dehydro- 
genation peak temperature underscores the enhanced catalytic 
activity of Bi2 Ti2 O7 . To further probe the dehydrogenation 
kinetics of the composite material, the activation energy ( Ea ) 
for hydrogen desorption was calculated using the Kissinger 
method (Equation (1)), derived from the DSC data: 
ln 
 
β
T 2 
p 
 
= −Ea 
RTp 
+ ln ( AR /Ea ) 
(1) 
The parameters β, Tp , A , and R represent the heating rate, 
the absolute temperature at the peak desorption rate, the factor 
before the exponential term, and the gas constant, respectively. 
The value of Tp is derived from the DSC curves shown in 
Fig. 4 (c). The activation energy ( Ea ) of the samples was deter- 
mined by ﬁtting the data presented in Figs. 4 (a–b). As shown 
in Fig. 4 (c), in comparison to the high Ea of pure MgH2 (ap- 
proximately 141.67 kJ ·mol−1 ), the Ea for the MgH2 –10 wt. % 
Bi2 Ti2 O7 composite is notably reduced to 82.14 kJ ·mol−1 . 
This substantial reduction directly attests to the ability of the 
Bi2 Ti2 O7 catalyst to lower the dehydrogenation kinetic bar- 
rier of MgH2 . Furthermore, as shown in Fig. S6 and Table 
S2, MgH2 –10 wt. % Bi2 Ti2 O7 composites have a relatively 
low Ea compared to many other hydrogen storage materials 
of the same type [11 , 29 , 42 , 48–49] . 
In addition, PCT measurements were carried out to further 
explore the thermodynamic properties of the MgH2 –10 wt. % 
Bi2 Ti2 O7 composite, as illustrated in Figs. 4 (d–e). During the 
dehydrogenation process, each PCT curve shows a single ﬂat 
plateau at a given temperature, corresponding to the decom- 
position of MgH2 into Mg and H2 . Based on PCT data, the 
decomposition enthalpy ( H ) was estimated using the Van’t 
Hoff equation [50] ( Eq. (2) ): 
ln P = H 
R T −S/ R 
(2) 
The parameters P, S, R, and T correspond to pressure, de- 
composition entropy, the ideal gas constant, and temperature, 
respectively. The Van’t Hoff plot derived from these measure- 
ments is shown in Fig. 4 (f). These PCT curves are employed 
to assess the effect of the Bi2 Ti2 O7 catalyst on the thermody- 
namic behavior of MgH2 . The curves for the MgH2 –10 wt. % 
Bi2 Ti2 O7 composite at temperatures of 320, 340, and 360 °C 
are presented in Fig. 4 (e). At the four temperatures, the equi- 
librium pressure of hydrogen absorption is 0.251, 0.381, 0.702 
and 0.989 MPa, respectively. Based on PCT data and using 
Van’t Hoff equation (calculation of decomposition heat H ), 
the ﬁtting Fig. 4 (f) obtained shows that the H of the de- 
hydrogenation process of MgH2 –10 wt. % Bi2 Ti2 O7 is 80.97 
kJ ·mol−1 , which is close to the 81.72 kJ ·mol−1 of the mea- 
sured MgH2 .This ﬁnding suggests that the enthalpy change 
of the MgH2 –10 wt. % Bi2 Ti2 O7 composite material remains 
largely unchanged, in line with previous reports that the ad- 
dition of catalysts does not signiﬁcantly affect the thermody- 
namic properties of MgH2 [51–52] . 
3.5. Cycling hydrogen storage properties 
To assess the cycling stability of the hydrogen storage 
material, the dehydrogenation performance of the MgH2 –
10 wt. % Bi2 Ti2 O7 composite was evaluated at 300 °C over 
multiple cycles, as depicted in Fig. 5 (a). The results demon- 
strate the composite’s excellent cycling stability. During the 
initial desorption cycle, a hydrogen release of 6.59 wt. % was 
achieved. However, subsequent cycles revealed a noticeable 
decline in hydrogen desorption, with the release decreasing 
to 5.3 wt. % after the fourth cycle. Notably, by the ﬁftieth cy-

98.1 % of its initial capacity from the ﬁfth to the ﬁftieth cy- 
cle. In practical applications, maintaining superior hydrogen 
storage performance over repeated cycles is essential for the 
advancement of magnesium-based hydrogen storage materi- 
als. 
To explore the underlying reasons for the observed de- 
crease in hydrogen desorption, comprehensive characteriza- 
tion analyses were performed on the material before and af- 
ter hydrogen absorption/desorption as well as during cycling. 
XRD was conducted on the material after the ﬁrst, ﬁfteenth, 
and ﬁftieth desorption cycles, as shown in Fig. 5 (b). The re- 
sults reveal that, after 15 and 50 cycles, the material’s com- 
position remained largely unchanged compared to the ﬁrst 
desorption cycle. Mg still predominated, but a small amount 
of MgH2 remained, as evidenced by a diffraction peak at

39.855 °, corresponding to the (200) plane. Incomplete de- 
hydrogenation was identiﬁed as a contributing factor to the 
decrease in cycling capacity. Fig. S7 presents the XRD pat- 
terns of the composite after ball milling, as well as after the 
1st, 15th, and 50th hydrogen absorption cycles. The anal- 
ysis reveals that the diffraction peaks corresponding to the 
Bi2 Mg3 alloy phase and metallic Mg are signiﬁcantly inten- 
siﬁed compared to those after the initial hydrogen absorp- 
tion. The enhanced peaks of the Bi2 Mg3 phase suggest that 
this alloy becomes more stable during repeated hydrogena- 
tion/dehydrogenation cycles due to the optimized interfacial 
structure. The increased intensity of the Mg peaks indicates 
that the dehydrogenation of MgH2 proceeds more completely, 
with the released Mg not being fully rehydrogenated. These 
ﬁndings demonstrate that the composite develops a stable 
catalytic-alloy synergistic mechanism during cycling. In the 
TEM characterization of Fig. 5 (c), the dark spots consistent 
with that in Fig. 2 (b) can be clearly observed, corresponding 
to the stable Bi2 Mg3 alloy phase in the process of hydrogen 
absorption and desorption. The measurement results of lattice 
spacing in selected areas are shown in Fig. 5 (d). The part of 
crystal plane spacing of 0.234 nm corresponds to the (110) 
crystal face of Bi2 Mg3 , and the part of crystal plane spacing 
of 0.324 nm corresponds to the (110) crystal face of TiO2 , 
and the measurement results are also reﬂected in the SAED 
diffraction ring. The above characterization analysis conﬁrms 
the accuracy of XRD. In addition, EDS observations of the 
material in Fig. 5 (e) show that Mg elements partially overlap 
with Bi elements, which also conﬁrms the above speculation. 
Additionally, SEM images of the composite material after ball 
milling, dehydrogenation, and 15 cycles are shown in Fig. S8. 
SEM observations revealed signiﬁcant particle agglomeration 
after hydrogen absorption, which contributed to a reduction 
in desorbed hydrogen during the second cycle. However, af- 
ter ten cycles, the particles were observed to disperse into 
ﬁner particles, which likely accounts for the stabilization of 
desorption capacity from the sixth cycle onward.

tion/desorption cycles. The results demonstrate that, after de- 
hydrogenation, the MgH2 phase largely vanishes, with Mg 
emerging as the predominant phase. Characteristic diffrac- 
tion peaks at 32.193 °, 34.398 °, and 36.619 ° correspond to 
the (100), (002), and (101) planes, respectively. The Bi2 Mg3 
alloy phase becomes more discernible, while a small amount 
of TiO2 is also detected, with a peak at 39.187 ° corresponding 
to the (200) plane. Due to the relatively low catalyst content, 
the TiO2 peaks are subtle. After hydrogen reabsorption, the 
Mg characteristic peaks remain partially visible at 36.619 °
(the (101) plane), indicating that the hydrogenation of the 
Mg phase is incomplete. The presence of the Bi2 Mg3 alloy 
phase remains evident, conﬁrming that it stabilizes during the 
hydrogen absorption and desorption cycles, contributing cat- 
alytically to the process. Further in-situ XRD measurements 
were performed during the heating desorption process within 
the temperature range of 150 °C to 400 °C, as shown in 
Fig. 6 (b). At temperatures of 250 °C and 300 °C, the Mg 
diffraction peaks emerge, while the MgH2 peaks persist, sug- 
gesting partial decomposition of MgH2 . At 350 °C, only Mg 
peaks are observed, indicating nearly complete decomposition 
of MgH2 . Additionally, weak peaks associated with the MgO 
phase appear alongside the main Mg peaks, likely due to the 
slight oxidation of the material, resulting in the formation of 
a MgO layer on the surface of the Mg particles. 
In addition, XPS analysis was performed to gain deeper 
insights into the changes in the valence states of Bi and Ti 
during the ball milling, dehydrogenation, and hydrogenation 
processes. Figs. 6 (c–d) depict the evolution of the valence 
states of these elements. The Bi 4f XPS spectrum of the 
ball-milled product was deconvoluted into two pairs of XPS 
peaks corresponding to the 4f5/2 and 4f7/2 spin-orbit compo- 
nents, revealing the presence of Bi3 + (162.34 eV/157.43 eV) 
and Bi0 (160.56 eV/155.24 eV). This conﬁrms that, during 
ball milling, a portion of the Bi was reduced from the Bi3 + 
state to the metallic Bi0 state. During dehydrogenation, the 
catalyst continued to undergo reduction, and Bi reacted with 
Mg to form the Bi2 Mg3 alloy. Additionally, the XPS spec- 
tra collected after hydrogen absorption and desorption cycles 
exhibited no signiﬁcant changes, indicating that both the ox- 
idation and metallic states of Bi remained stable through- 
out the hydrogenation and dehydrogenation processes. During 
ball milling, the MgH2 –10 wt. % Bi2 Ti2 O7 composite inter- 
acted with MgH2 to form TiO2 , which persisted throughout 
the process. Reduction reactions also occurred, resulting in 
the formation of small amounts of Ti3 + and Ti0 , which can 
serve as an electron transfer mediator that accelerates the de- 
hydrogenation reaction, thereby promoting the formation of 
the Bi2 Mg3 alloy phase. Although the Ti content was rela- 
tively low, preventing the appearance of distinct Ti peaks in 
the XRD data, these changes were identiﬁed by the XPS spec- 
tra. The involvement of multivalent Ti in the reaction aided 
electron transfer between Mg2 + and H−, thus promoting the 
dehydrogenation [50] . In addition, As shown in Fig. S9(b), 
after hydrogen absorption, the binding energy of lattice oxy- 
gen in the composite recovers to a level close to that of the 
ball-milled state, while the surface hydroxyl binding energy 
slightly decreases. Concurrently, new surface-adsorbed oxy- 
gen peaks emerge, accompanied by the formation of oxygen 
vacancies. During catalysis, these oxygen vacancies function 
as preferential adsorption and reaction sites. By providing 
speciﬁc chemical environments, they facilitate reaction pro- 
gression. Moreover, the oxygen vacancies enhance the charge 
transfer of electrons or holes, thereby altering the chemical 
reaction rates and inﬂuencing the kinetic processes of the re- 
action. 
To further explore the catalytic role of Bi2 Ti2 O7 in enhanc- 
ing the hydrogen storage capacity of MgH2 , DFT calculations 
were performed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. The 
initial computational model, as previously described, under- 
went structural optimization to achieve a more stable con- 
ﬁguration. The (444) crystal plane of Bi2 Ti2 O7 was selected 
for analysis, as it is the most likely to be exposed during the 
process. Charge transfer between MgH2 and Bi2 Ti2 O7 was in- 
vestigated using electron density difference (EDD) and Bader 
charge distribution analyses ( Fig. 7 (a)), Fig. S10 shows other 
supported views. The EDD diagram in Fig. 7 (a) indicates that 
MgH2 adsorbs onto the O atom, and charge transfer occurs 
between the MgH2 and Bi2 Ti2 O7 interface, making the Mg-H 
bond unstable. This catalyzes the decomposition of MgH2 and 
promotes the formation of the Bi2 Mg3 alloy. Meanwhile, the 
DOS result in Fig. 7 (e) shows a hybridization between the Bi 
p orbitals and the Mg p orbitals, indicating that the Bi2 Mg3 
alloy phase can be easily generated after the interaction with 
Bi2 Ti2 O7 and MgH2 , further verifying the above conclusion. 
Furthermore, the hybridization was found between Ti 3d and 
H 1s in the DOS diagram, indicating a strong interaction be- 
tween Ti and H, which led to an increase in the polarity of 
the Mg-H bond and an elongation of the bond length, thereby 
reducing the kinetic barrier of hydrogen release. 
In order to deeply study the mechanism of action of 
Bi2 Ti2 O7 , Bi2 Mg3 was incorporated into the computational 
model and discussed and analyzed together with Bi2 Ti2 O7 
and the comparison sample TiO2 . The results in Fig. 7 (b) and 
Fig. S11 demonstrate that the Mg-H bond lengths in MgH2 - 
Bi2 Ti2 O7 , MgH2 -Bi2 Mg3 , and MgH2 -TiO2 systems measure 
1.83 ˚A, 1.792 ˚A, and 1.70 ˚A, respectively. Among them, the 
Mg-H bond under the inﬂuence of Bi2 Ti2 O7 and Bi2 Mg3 
was signiﬁcantly longer than the 1.71 ˚A bond length of 
the original MgH2 [53] . This elongation demonstrates that 
the Bi2 Ti2 O7 and Bi2 Mg3 alloy can weaken the Mg-H bond 
strength, facilitating bond cleavage and consequently lower- 
ing the dehydrogenation temperature of MgH2 [54] . Fig. 7 (c) 
shows the negative adsorption energies of the three systems, 
conﬁrming the exothermic H2 adsorption process. The lower 
adsorption energy is associated with higher system stability, 
indicating that both Bi2 Ti2 O7 and Bi2 Mg3 have good adsorp- 
tion capacities. Compared to the reference 1.21 eV disso- 
ciation barrier on Mg(0001) surfaces (the rate-limiting step 
in hydrogenation) [55] , Fig. 7 (d) shows that Bi2 Ti2 O7 and 
its derived Bi2 Mg3 phase signiﬁcantly reduce this barrier to 
0.33 eV and 0.47 eV respectively, while TiO2 only reaches 
1.14 eV. This indicates that Bi2 Ti2 O7 and Bi2 Mg3 promote 
the dissociation of H2 , highlighting their special catalytic ac-

Bi2 Ti2 O7 and Bi2 Mg3 after hydrogen dissociation in different 
transition states. 
The catalytic mechanism of the Bi2 Ti2 O7 on MgH2 can 
be thoroughly clariﬁed by integrating results from a range of 
analyses, including XRD, XPS, TEM, SAED, and DFT, of- 
fering a more detailed and comprehensive understanding. In 
pure MgH2 , the lack of an electron transfer medium impedes 
the efﬁcient dissociation of hydrogen molecules. In contrast, 
Bi2 Ti2 O7 , a bimetallic oxide, although less stable than the 
monometallic Bi2 O3 , exhibits high reactivity of the Bi species. 
This reactivity facilitates its interaction with MgH2 during the 
ball milling process, leading to the formation of the Bi2 Mg3 
alloy phase. The in-situ formation of this alloy phase effec- 
tively enhances the kinetics of the MgH2 system, primarily 
by creating additional hydrogen diffusion channels through 
the increased number of interfaces. This catalysis lowers the 
dehydrogenation temperature and accelerates the overall de- 
hydrogenation kinetics. 
Fig. 8 shows the mechanism diagram of the catalytic pro- 
cess. MgH2 -Bi2 Ti2 O7 composites formed rich interfaces in 
the process of hydrogen absorption and discharge reaction, 
where the multivalent Ti species act as mediators for elec- 
tron transfer between Mg2 + and H−. During ball milling, the 
MgH2 –10 wt. % Bi2 Ti2 O7 sample reacts with MgH2 , forming 
TiO2 , which remains present throughout the process. Concur- 
rently, reduction reactions occur, converting a portion of Ti4 + 
to Ti3 + and Ti0 . This multivalent titanium-based catalyst not 
only offers a large number of active catalytic sites through 
its extensive interaction with MgH2 but also facilitates rapid 
electron transfer and efﬁcient hydrogen atom or molecule dif- 
fusion. Moreover, the hollow spherical structure of Bi2 Ti2 O7 , 
with its high speciﬁc surface area, further contributes to the 
presence of active sites, enhancing its catalytic performance

4. Conclusions 
In summary, the successful synthesis and application of 
hollow Bi2 Ti2 O7 microspheres signiﬁcantly elevate the hy- 
drogen storage performance of magnesium-based materials. 
Experimental results reveal that the MgH2 -Bi2 Ti2 O7 compos- 
ite demonstrates superior hydrogen storage capacity compared 
to the separately mixed Bi2 O3 and TiO2 materials. This en- 
hancement can be chieﬂy due to the synergistic catalytic effect 
among the constituent elements. The interaction between Bi 
and MgH2 promotes the formation of the Bi2 Mg3 alloy, which 
accelerates hydrogen diffusion within the MgH2 , thereby fur- 
ther improving its catalytic performance. Moreover, TiO2 and 
the multivalent transition metal Ti not only provide catalytic 
active sites but also facilitate efﬁcient electron transfer. The 
transition metal oxide functions as an effective buffer, prevent- 
ing powder agglomeration. As a result, the synergistic effects 
within the composite material lead to a substantial improve- 
ment in hydrogen storage performance. This study not only 
presents a novel approach to catalyst structural design by en- 
hancing hydrogen adsorption and diffusion facilitated by syn- 
ergistic catalysis and enhanced surface area but also drives 
MgH2 towards more efﬁcient and stable hydrogen storage, 
laying the foundation for the wider application of hydrogen 
energy technologies.
