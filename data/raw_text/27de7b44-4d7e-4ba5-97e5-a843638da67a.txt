One of the most commonly used materials for sorption compression in space applications is based on the La-Ni-H 
system. The degradation of the material properties and, therefore, the system lifetime is of great importance for 
the final success of a potential space mission. Considering that satellites and other equipment that have to 
operate in space are expected to be fully functional for more than 10 years, in this work, an accelerated aging 
method is designed and carried out to predict the La-Ni-H system properties after 12 years under specific 
operating conditions. For this test, several specimens of fully hydrogenated LaNi5 are exposed to specific 
hydrogen pressures (i.e., 20, 35, 58 and 96 bar) at different temperatures (i.e., 50, 90, 130 and 160 ◦C) for a 
duration of 90 days. Sievert’s type apparatus, synchrotron radiation powder X-ray diffraction (SR-PXD), quasi- 
elastic neutron scattering (QENS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and small-angle X-ray scattering 
(SAXS) methods are used to investigate the material aging and its impact on the material chemical and micro­
structural properties.
1. Introduction
Many highly sensitive instruments designed for space applications, e. 
g., infrared, gamma-ray and X-ray detectors, require constant cryogenic 
operating temperatures. While stored cryogens and passive cryo­
radiators have both been used for cryogenic cooling on numerous space 
missions, the ultimate goal of scientists and mission planners has always 
been to develop refrigerators capable of reaching relatively low cryogen 
temperatures (much lower than what passive radiators can achieve) and 
having a lifespan of several years [1]. In this regard, cryogenic coolers 
(cryocoolers) are essential for achieving accurate cryogenic temperature 
control in space [2,3]. However, the mechanical compressors that drive 
the first cryocoolers have moving parts and produce vibration, which 
significantly hinders their practical applications when combined with 
highly sensitive equipment.
With features like low vibration, no electromagnetic interference, 
high reliability, and extended operating life, sorption compressors based 
on the Joule–Thomson (J–T) effect are becoming viable solutions for 
space applications [4]. The sorbents used for the sorption compressors 
can be divided into two types based on the working mechanism, i.e., 
physical and chemical. Metal-based systems with a particular affinity for 
hydrogen can serve as sorbent materials in sorption compressors, 
regulating temperatures by varying hydrogen pressures and flow rates 
[5,6]. Moreover, metal hydride sorbents are non-corrosive, non-toxic, 
and easy to handle, rendering them appealing for such purposes. LaNi5, 
a well-studied low-temperature metal hydride [7], has been already 
utilized in these space sorption compressors for the European Space 
Agency (ESA) Planck Mission [3,8].
In light of the fact that satellites and other space-related equipment 
must run flawlessly for often more than ten years, an accelerated aging 
method was developed in this work to forecast the La-Ni-H system fea­
tures after twelve years of operation. The as received and aged samples’ 
hydrogen storage properties were investigated by Sievert’s type appa­
ratus and microstructures were characterized by synchrotron radiation

2. Experimental methods
The investigated material in this study was extracted from a 
rechargeable hydrogen container model BL-30, purchased from 
Hydrogen Components, Inc. The extracted material consisted of LaNi5 
plus ca. 5 wt% of TeflonTM i.e., polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), which is 
referred to as LaNi5 in the following. The opening of the tank and the 
powder material handling were carried out in an Ar-filled glovebox (O2 
and H2O levels < 1 ppm).
To characterize the materials’ hydrogen storage properties, the 
samples were loaded into a PCT-Pro Setaram & Hy-Energy manometric 
Sievert-type apparatus and evacuated for 30 min at room temperature. 
Then the samples were exposed to helium for volume calibration 
(pressure in the range of 3 – 5 bar). The overall procedure lasted about 
15 min. Pressure composition isotherm (PCI) measurements were per­
formed at different temperatures, i.e., 20, 30, 40, and 50 ◦C. The tem­
perature of the sample holder was controlled by a water bath (CORIO 
CD-601F, Julabo GmbH). The variations of reaction enthalpy (ΔH) 
and entropy (ΔS) for hydrogenation/dehydrogenation were obtained 
utilizing the van’t Hoff equation (Eq. (1)) and previously acquired PCI 
measurements: 
ln Peq
P0
= ΔH
RT −ΔS
R
(1) 
where P0 is the standard pressure, Peq is the equilibrium pressure, R is 
the universal gas constant and T represents the sample temperature. The 
kinetic properties of the as received sample were investigated by using a 
PCT-Pro Setaram and a Hy-Energy manometric Sievert-type apparatus. 
The measurements were carried out at 20, 30, 40 and 50 ◦C, while the 
hydrogen pressures applied to the specimens for the hydrogenation and 
the dehydrogenation measurements were 45 and 0.5 −
2 bar, 
respectively.
An accelerated calendar aging method [9] was used to predict the 
aging behavior of the material, assuming that the aging follows an 
Arrhenius behavior: 
α = A • exp
(−Ea
RT
)
(2) 
where A is a fitting parameter based on the relationship of the properties 
and the temperatures and Ea is the activation energy of the reaction that 
happens at temperature T. Note that α represents different factors that 
are related to the material properties, i.e. change of capacity and equi­
librium pressure. The original batch of LaNi5 was divided into several 
smaller batches and subjected to 20, 35, 58 and 96 bar of hydrogen 
pressure for 90 days at temperatures of 50, 90, 130 and 160 ◦C, 
respectively. The samples were loaded into stainless sample holders and 
were kept at the above-mentioned temperatures by using oil baths and 
ceramic ovens. Aluminum foils were employed to cover the conical 
flasks to mitigate heat and oil losses.
Microstructural investigations using synchrotron radiation powder 
X-ray diffraction (SR-PXD) were conducted at beamline P02.1, PETRA 
III of DESY in Hamburg, Germany. A Varex 4343CT detector was used, 
and the wavelength was set at 0.2074 Å. A LaB6 standard from NIST was 
used to calibrate the sample-to-detector distance (SDD). The samples 
were loaded into the glass capillaries and sealed with glue inside an Ar-

filled glovebox (O2 and H2O levels < 1 ppm). FIT2D software was used to 
convert the recorded 2D images into numerical data [10].
Quasi-elastic neutron scattering (QENS) measurements were con­
ducted with cold neutrons using the time-of-flight neutron spectrometer 
(FOCUS) located at the continuous spallation source SINQ at the Paul 
Scherrer Institute (Villigen, Switzerland). The incident neutron wave­
length was 4.4 Å, and the elastic scattering energy resolution, δ(E), was 
0.223 meV (full width at half maximum, FWHM), corresponding to an 
observable time τ ≈2ℏ/FWHM of 5.9 ps. The samples were loaded into 
sealed aluminum cylinders (6-mm diameter) inside the Ar-continuously 
filled glovebox. The spectra were recorded in a range of scattering 
vectors from Q = 0.3 to 2.5 Å-1. Data reduction was carried out using the 
DAVE software (data analysis and visualization environment). The ac­
quired QENS spectra were analyzed using the curve fitting utility PAN 
included in DAVE. The measured total incoherent scattering function S 
(Q,ω) (Eq. (3)) can be expressed as a convolution of an elastic scattering 
described by the delta function δ(ω) and a quasi-elastic contribution 
described by the Lorentzian function L(Q,ω), with a flat background (bg) 
to account for fast motions and the resolution function of the instrument 
R(Q,ω) determined using a vanadium standard:
S(Q,ω) = R(Q,ω) ⊗[Ielδ(ω) + Iqe L(Q,ω)] + bg (3).
where Iel and Iqe are the elastic and integrated quasi-elastic scattering 
intensities, respectively.
The morphologies of the materials were revealed by using a field- 
emission scanning electron microscope (FEI Quanta 650 SEM) in both 
secondary electron (SE) and backscattered electron (BSE) modes. The 
preparation of the sample was handled in an Ar-filled glovebox with 
values of O2 and H2O < 1 ppm. For each sample, 200 particles were 
selected in order to get the average particle size and analyze the particle 
size distribution. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) with an 
EDAX system equipped in the SEM was used to analyze the elemental 
compositions of the targeted areas for the samples.
The microstructural features of the investigated samples were further 
investigated using a laboratory SAXS instrument (Xenocs Xeuss 3.0 
system). The instrument was equipped with a Dectris Pilatus3 R 300 K 
detector and microfocus tubes with Cu and Mo anodes as sources 
operated at 50 kV and 0.6 mA (Cu) and 1.0 mA (Mo). In this investi­
gation, the Kα radiation line (0.71 Å) of the Molybdenum source was 
applied to acquire the SAXS data. All SAXS samples were prepared inside 
a glovebox with a continuously running purified Argon flow. The 
powdered samples were placed inside a circular hole of an aluminum 
holder and sealed on both sides with Kapton tape to avoid any change in 
the oxidation state of the samples by the transfer to the SAXS instrument 
and during the measurements. Furthermore, all measurements were 
conducted under dynamic vacuum to prevent possible oxidation state of 
the samples and to avoid any air scattering during the SAXS measure­
ments. In addition, the primary beam and an empty holder only with 
Kapton tape were measured to determine the transmission values of the 
samples. For all SAXS measurements, the area of illumination on the 
samples was set to roughly 500 × 500 μm2. The measurements were 
carried out at two SDD (dshort = 900 mm and dlong = 1800 mm) in order 
to cover the desired q-range, with an exposure time of 240 s and 3000 s, 
respectively. The aforementioned quantity q describes the scattering 
vector of the incident beam, which is given by: q = (4π/λ)sinθ, where 2θ 
refers to the scattering angle of the elastically scattered photons and λ is 
the corresponding monochromatic wavelength. All the fittings were 
done by SASfit software [11].
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Properties of the as received material
Firstly, the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of the as received 
LaNi5 were investigated. As the material readily absorbs hydrogen, no 
activation process was carried out prior to starting these investigations. 
Fig. 1a-c illustrates the PCI curves and the corresponding calculations of 
the ΔH and ΔS for both hydrogenation and dehydrogenation processes. 
The overall capacity of the as received material is around 1.27 wt%. The 
hydrogenation and dehydrogenation plateau pressures measured at half 
of the plateau length, for the PCI measurement carried out at 20 ◦C, are 
1.76 and 1.26 bar, respectively. At 30 ◦C, the plateau pressures for hy­
drogenation and dehydrogenation are 2.54 and 1.87 bar, respectively. 
At 40 ◦C, the values are 3.52 and 2.80 bar, respectively. Whereas the 
hydrogenation and dehydrogenation plateau pressures at 50 ◦C are 5.17 
and 4.06 bar, respectively. The plateau pressure values of this specimen 
and for the aged ones are reported in Table 1. By using the plateau 
pressure values measured at 20, 30, 40 and 50 ◦C, for the hydrogenation 
process, an enthalpy of reaction (ΔH) equals to −27.96 ± 0.95 kJ⋅mol−1 
and an entropy variation (ΔS) equals to −100.00 ± 3.09 J⋅mol-1K−1 
were obtained. Whereas for the dehydrogenation process, the obtained

values were ΔH = 30.73 ± 0.41 kJ⋅mol−1 and ΔS = 106.69 ± 1.33 
J⋅mol-1K−1. The kinetic properties of the materials at 20, 30, 40 and 
50 ◦C are reported in Fig. 1d. From these measurements, a hydrogen 
storage capacity of the as received material of around 1.25 wt% is 
observed. For all the investigated temperatures, the hydrogenation 
process is faster than the dehydrogenation process. For all temperatures 
tested, the hydrogenation process takes less than 1 min to reach 90 % of 
the entire hydrogenation capacity (Fig. 1e). Under all temperatures 
investigated, the dehydrogenation process takes less than 6 min; how­
ever, as the temperature decreases, the reaction rate steadily decreases.
3.2. Accelerated aging tests
To identify potential aging phenomena, accelerated aging tests were 
carried out. The applied temperatures and hydrogen pressures for the 
accelerated aging test were selected based on the equilibrium pressur­
e–temperature curves of the as received LaNi5 and based on a hypo­
thetical practical operating temperature of 50 ◦C in a hydrogenated 
state. To know the conditions of pressure and temperature where the 
material is in a fully hydrogenated state, a series of PCI measurements 
were carried out, see Fig. 1a. From the obtained data (Table 1), an 
equilibrium pressure curve was extrapolated for temperatures up to 
200 ◦C, see Fig. 2a. Based on this, the temperatures chosen for aging the 
as received material were 50, 90, 130 and 160 ◦C at hydrogen pressures 
of 20, 35, 58 and 96 bar, respectively. The temperatures for the accel­
erated aging measurements were chosen arbitrarily in a way that sig­
nificant information on the material’s aging in a reasonable time frame 
could be acquired, taking into account the instrumental limitations of 
the setup (e.g., 100 bar maximum hydrogen pressure applicable to 
prevent the metal hydride from decomposing). The tests were performed 
on the setup shown in Fig. 2b. The specimens were kept under constant 
temperature and pressure conditions for 90 days.
Fig. 3a exhibits the PCI curves of the material aged at 50 ◦C for 90 
days measured at 20, 30, 45 and 55 ◦C. After aging at 50 ◦C for 90 days, 
the measured hydrogen storage capacity is around 1.22 wt%, which is 
comparable to that of the as received material. As can be seen in Table 1, 
the PCI’s curves measured at 20 and 30 ◦C show hydrogenation plateau 
pressures higher (0.01 to 0.1 bar) than those of the as received materials. 
However, for the dehydrogenation plateau pressures at 20 and 30 ◦C, the 
values are ca. 0.16 and 0.04 bar lower than those of the as received 
material. The hydrogenation and dehydrogenation plateau pressures at 
45 ◦C are 4.66 and 3.32 bar, respectively. Whereas the hydrogenation 
and dehydrogenation plateau pressures at 55 ◦C are 6.54 and 4.88 bar, 
respectively. This indicates that after aging, the difference between 
hydrogenation and dehydrogenation, i.e. hysteresis, increases. Fig. 3b 
and c illustrate the van’t Hoff plots and associated hydrogenation and 
dehydrogenation ΔH and ΔS values for LaNi5 aged at 50 ◦C. For the 
hydrogenation process, ΔH = −29.95 ± 0.13 kJ⋅mol−1 and ΔS =
−106.89 ± 0.42 J⋅mol-1K−1 were determined, whereas for the dehy­
drogenation process, ΔH = 33.73 ± 0.81 kJ⋅mol−1; ΔS = 116.03 ± 2.63 
J⋅mol-1K-1were obtained. The values for the ΔH and ΔS are greatly 
different from the as received materials, indicating that the material’s 
microstructure may be changed due to aging.
Similar to at 50 ◦C, Fig. 3d displays the PCI curves of the material 
aged at 90 ◦C for 90 days. The material has a hydrogen storage capability 
of around 1.2 wt%. Also in this case, the hydrogenation plateau pres­
sures for the curves measured at 20 and 30 ◦C are 0.24 and 0.44 bar 
higher than the values of the as received LaNi5. The dehydrogenation 
plateau pressures at 20 and 30 ◦C are 1.14 and 1.77 bar, respectively. 
The hydrogenation plateau pressures at 45 and 55 ◦C are 4.15 and 6.44 
bar, respectively. The dehydrogenation plateau pressures at 45 and 
55 ◦C are 3.26 and 4.79 bar, respectively, see Table 1. The corresponding 
ΔH and ΔS for hydrogenation and dehydrogenation are ΔH = –32.99 ±
0.92 kJ⋅mol−1 and ΔS = −115.81 ± 2.96 J⋅mol-1K-1and ΔH = 32.77 ±
0.12 kJ⋅mol−1 and ΔS = 112.85 ± 0.37 J⋅mol-1K−1, respectively (Fig. 3e 
and f). In this case too, the ΔH and ΔS values differ significantly from 
those of the materials received, although they are similar to the sample 
that was aged for 90 days at 50 ◦C (Fig. 3b-c).
The PCI curves of the material aged at 130 ◦C for 90 days at 20, 30, 
45 and 55 ◦C in Fig. 3g demonstrate a material hydrogen storage ca­
pacity of 1.05 wt%, thus significantly lower than the previously inves­
tigated specimens. Additionally, for the curves measured at 20 and 
30 ◦C, the average hydrogenation plateau pressures (1.45 bar at 20 ◦C 
and 1.87 bar at 30 ◦C) are close to that of the as received materials but 
the plateaus present significant slopes. Similar to previous aged samples, 
the dehydrogenation plateau pressures at 20 and 30 ◦C for the 130 ◦C 
aged sample are around 0.34 and 0.42 bar lower than the values for the 
as received material. The hydrogenation plateau pressures at 45 and 
55 ◦C are 3.40 and 5.25 bar, respectively. The dehydrogenation plateau 
pressures at 45 and 55 ◦C are 2.77 and 4.18 bar, respectively, see 
Table 1. From the calculations in Fig. 3h and i, the following values of 
enthalpy and entropy variations for the hydrogenation and dehydroge­
nation processes were obtained, i.e., ΔH = −29.68 ± 2.58 kJ⋅mol−1 and 
ΔS = −103.78 ± 8.33 J⋅mol-1K−1, and ΔH = 34.44 ± 0.31 kJ⋅mol−1 and 
ΔS = 116.78 ± 1.01 J⋅mol-1K−1.
When aged at 160 ◦C for 90 days, the overall material hydrogen 
storage capacity significantly decreases to 0.68 wt%, whereas the 
plateau length is only 0.5 wt% (see Fig. 3j), and the plateaus are 
markedly sloppy. At a given temperature, PCI curves should show a flat 
plateau consequent to the continuous conversion between α phase (alloy

hydrogen solid solution) and β phase (hydride phase), but metal hy­
drides often do not exhibit a perfectly flat plateau due to local chemical 
inhomogeneities. This is the case of the materials investigated in this 
work. In the case of the 160 ◦C aged sample, the PCI measurements do 
not show clear plateaus. To keep consistency with the other samples, the 
pressure values in the middle of the absorption curve were considered 
for determining the hydrogenation/dehydrogenation enthalpies and 
entropies. The identification of the material aging mechanism did not 
take the pressure values of 160 ◦C aged sample into account. The hy­
drogenation plateau pressures at 20 and 30 ◦C significantly decrease to

0.67 and 0.78 bar, respectively. Compared to the dehydrogenation 
plateau pressures for the as received LaNi5, the values at 20 and 30 ◦C 
decrease to 0.42 and 0.61 bar, respectively. The hydrogenation plateau 
pressures at 45 and 55 ◦C are 1.28 and 1.67 bar, respectively. The 
dehydrogenation plateau pressures at 45 and 55 ◦C are 1.06 and 1.51 
bar, respectively, see Table 1. The corresponding ΔH and ΔS for hy­
drogenation and dehydrogenation are shown in Fig. 3k and l, respec­
tively. The absolute enthalpy and entropy values for both hydrogenation 
and dehydrogenation are smaller than those of the previously mentioned 
samples. For the hydrogenation process, ΔH = −21.50 ± 2.29 kJ⋅mol−1 
and ΔS = −69.60 ± 7.38 J⋅mol-1K−1; For the dehydrogenation process, 
ΔH = 29.40 ± 0.36 kJ⋅mol−1 and ΔS = 92.98 ± 1.18 J⋅mol-1K−1. 
However, due to the fact that the obtained ΔH and ΔS for the 160 ◦C 
aged sample have large errors, they were not used for subsequent aging 
calculations.
The kinetic properties of the 50 ◦C aged material at 20, 30, 40 and 
50 ◦C are shown in Fig. 4a. The overall capacity of the sample is about 
1.18 wt%. The hydrogenation process can reach 90 % capacity within 1 
min at all the investigated temperatures, see Fig. 4e. For the dehydro­
genation process, it is worth noting that the dehydrogenation at 20 ◦C 
proceeds rather slowly, and only 0.70 wt% of hydrogen can be released 
within the timeframe of 30 min. When the dehydrogenation tempera­
ture increases, the time decreases to less than 6 min. Fig. 4b shows the 
results of hydrogenation and dehydrogenation at 20, 30, 40 and 50 ◦C 
for 90 ◦C aged LaNi5, with an overall hydrogen capacity of about 1.18 wt 
%. Similar to the 50 ◦C aged sample, the hydrogenation process is 
relatively faster than the dehydrogenation process, completing 90 % of 
the reaction in less than 1 min. For the dehydrogenation process, only 
0.75 wt% hydrogen can be released in 30 min at 20 ◦C. As the measuring 
temperature is increased, the kinetic rates increase, as illustrated in 
Fig. 4b and Fig. 4f. Under identical experimental conditions, the 
hydrogen concentration of the sample aged at 130 ◦C is 0.99 wt%, as 
illustrated in Fig. 4c. Note that there is a significant difference between 
the dehydrogenation kinetic properties at 20, 30 ◦C and other

temperatures. For instance, only 0.43 and 0.77 wt% hydrogen can be 
released when dehydrogenating for 30 min at 20 and 30 ◦C, respectively. 
Whereas, the material can desorb 0.99 wt% hydrogen at 40 and 50 ◦C. 
The 130 ◦C aged sample takes less than 0.8 min to reach 90 % of the total 
hydrogenation hydrogen content than the other samples, as demon­
strated in Fig. 4g. There are no significant differences in the dehydro­
genation time between this material and the materials that were aged at 
50 and 90 ◦C. Fig. 4d displays the hydrogenation and dehydrogenation 
kinetics of the 160 ◦C aged sample measured at 20, 30, 40 and 50 ◦C. 
Consistently with the PCI findings, this material has a hydrogen storage 
capacity of 0.49 wt%. For all investigated temperatures, the time needed 
to complete 90 % of the hydrogenation process is under 0.3 min 
(Fig. 4h). Whereas, for all the investigated temperatures, the time 
required to achieve 90 % of the dehydrogenation capacity is under 3 
min. In particular, at 20 ◦C, these findings show that the hydrogenation 
and dehydrogenation rates of the material as well as its achievable 
hydrogen storage capacity are affected by material aging.
Based on the PCI and kinetic curves, it is clear that the exposures to 
increasing temperatures and pressures affect the material properties 
(including hydrogen storage capacity and thermodynamic properties) in 
a discernible way, thus indicating that the aging effects are indeed 
sensible. For understanding the reason behind the observed phenomena, 
in-depth microstructural investigations were carried out via SR-PXD, 
QENS, SEM-EDS and SAXS techniques in the following.
3.3. Microstructure evolutions
To analyze the microstructure evolution of the different specimens, 
SR-PXD analyses of the samples before and after aging were carried out. 
The SR-PXD pattern of the as received material (Fig. 5a) indicates that 
LaNi5 is the main phase in all samples, with no detectable reflections 
corresponding to other phases such as Ni or La. However, due to the 
aging process, the intensities for different Bragg reflection peaks were 
changed. For example, the intensities of the (1–1–1) and (2–2–2) re­
flections decrease after aging, while the intensities of the (200) and 
(002) reflections show clear increments after aging. Note that the in­
tensities of the peaks were normalized to ensure that the comparison is 
meaningful. Fig. 5b illustrates the lattice constants of the samples. LaNi5 
crystallizes in the hexagonal structure of space group P6/mmm. The 
lattice constants a and c obtained for the as received sample are 5.0242 
± 1.9 × 10-4 Å and 3.9822 ± 8.5 × 10-4 Å, respectively and the c/a ratio 
is equal to 0.793. The c value for samples aged at 50, 90, and 130 ◦C 
exhibits a clear increasing trend. The a values decrease after aging 
except for the sample aged at 160 ◦C. Additionally, a noticeable increase 
in the c/a ratio is observed. These changes reveal that there may be some 
residual compressive stresses on the a-axis and some residual tensile 
stresses on the c-axis after the aging studies.
Understanding the evolution of the lattice strain is apparently 
essential for revealing the aging mechanism. The lattice strain (ε) for 
each lattice plane was calculated by the following equation: 
εhkl = dhkl −dhkl,0
dhkl,0
(4) 
where dhkl is the d-spacing of the hkl lattice plane, and dhkl,0 is the d- 
spacing of the hkl lattice plane of the reference samples, in this case, the 
as received LaNi5. As can be seen in Fig. 5c, the lattice strain depends on 
the crystallographic planes, indicating the materials’ behavior during 
aging is anisotropic. The (001) plane shows the largest lattice strain, 
which means that this plane has the lowest elastic stiffness by assuming 
the stress for each material is identical. Also notice that the lattice strain 
on most of the planes increases after aging. The changes of FWHM were 
also calculated, see Fig. 5d. The FWHM increases after aging for all 
planes, especially for the (200). Note that particle size decrement and

lattice strain increment are potential causes of peak broadening.
To further unveil the reason behind the observed aging phenomena, 
the parameters related to defects, such as dislocation density (ρ) were 
analyzed by using the SR-PXD data. Williamson and Hall [12] proposed 
that the physical line broadening ΔK can be determined by the following 
equations: 
ΔK = 0.9
D + εK
(5.1) 
ΔK = 2Δθ cosθ
λ
(5.2) 
K = 2sinθ
λ
= q
2π
(5.3) 
where D is the crystallite size, Δθ is the FWHM in the SR-PXD patterns, λ 
is the wavelength and ε is the lattice strain. The relation between lattice 
strain and dislocation density can be written as: 
ρ = B
(ε
b
)2
(6) 
where b is the length of the Burgers vector, and B is a uniform parameter 
related to the elastic modulus and dislocation configuration of the 
material.
However, if we consider that the elastic module for the lattice is 
anisotropic, dislocations on a specific crystal plane cause different dis­
tortions on different crystal planes. Therefore, the value of B is influ­
enced by the anisotropic behavior of the material. Ung´ar and Borb´ely 
[13] considered the distortion caused by dislocations on different crystal 
planes, and pointed out to use the average contrast factor (C) to modify 
the K parameter, which is called the modified Williamson-Hall method:

where O(K2C) is a high-order term of KC1/2 and is usually ignored. M is a 
parameter that depends on the effective outer cut-out radius (Re) of 
dislocations and the dislocation density (M = Reρ
1
2 [14], of which ln Re
b =
2π). The value of C is affected by the elastic constants, dislocation type 
and crystal plane index. For the hexagonal structure, C is given by the 
following equation [15,16]:

Here, the h, k and l are the Miller indices corresponding to each

Note that the instrumental broadening also contributes to the profile 
line broadening of the samples, therefore, it has to be deducted before 
calculating the ρ values. Here we used the following function to get the 
peak broadening from the samples:

measurement and instrument, respectively. The instrumental broad­
ening was obtained from the standard LaB6 material.
By applying linear fitting of the ΔK versus KC1/2 (Fig. 6a), the value 
of ρ can be obtained from the slope. The obtained dislocation densities 
for each sample are shown in Fig. 6b. If we assume that all the dislo­
cations in the samples are edge dislocations, we can see that for the as 
received LaNi5, the dislocation density is 6.72 × 1014 m−2. After aging, 
the dislocation density increases gradually with temperature, where the 
dislocation density is around 16.77 × 1014 m−2 for the sample aged at 
160 ◦C, which is more than 2 times of that for the as received material. If 
we would assume that all the dislocations are screw dislocations, the 
dislocation densities are smaller than those for edge dislocation, but 
with aging at different temperatures, the same trend is observed. The 
results indicate that aging has a strong influence on the dislocation 
density and thus affects the materials’ properties.
The QENS spectra of the as received and 160 ◦C aged samples are 
shown in Fig. 7. These measured spectra were fitted according to Eq. 
(3). The fit comprises two components: an elastic contribution repre­
sented by the Delta function, δ(ω), and a quasi-elastic broadening 
component described by the Lorentzian function L(Q,ω). The spectra of 
both samples appear similar, suggesting a comparable chemical envi­
ronment across the samples. Furthermore, the fit results show no quasi- 
elastic broadening, indicating the absence of observable motion in these 
samples. The results are in good agreement with the SR-PXD data, 
indicating that there is no hydrogen-related phase presented in all aged 
samples even for the LaNi5 aged at the highest temperature (160 ◦C) for 
90 days.
Scanning electron microscopy with SEM-EDS was used to study the 
material particles’ morphology and particle size distribution. Addi­
tionally, the mapping of elemental distribution was carried out. SEM 
images of the as received material are shown in Fig. 8. Both the sec­
ondary electron (SE) and backscattered electron (BSE) images (Fig. 8a-f) 
show that the size distribution of metal hydride particles is not homo­
geneous, while the metal hydride particles are embedded well in Teflon. 
For each sample, 200 particles were selected, and their size was 
measured using ImageJ software. This data was subsequently analyzed 
and fitted to a Gaussian distribution model, yielding the average particle 
size. The average particle length of the as received material was calcu­
lated to be 28.96 μm, see Fig. 8g. From the EDS mappings for the ele­
ments of C, F, La, and Ni (Fig. 8h), it appears clear that the LaNi5 metal 
hydride is embedded in a polymeric matrix. One particle of the metal 
hydride was selected to check the elemental composition, see Fig. S1. 
The quantitative results are shown in Table S1. Although the atomic 
ratios between La and Ni are not exactly 5:1, they are still in the range of 
4:1 to 5:1, confirming that the investigated phase is LaNi5.
Images from SEM of the material after 90 days of aging at 50 ◦C 
indicate that the size of metal hydride particles is smaller than that of the 
as received material. Cracks are visible in some particles (Fig. 9a-f). As 
clearly shown in Fig. 9g, the average particle size decreases to 16.77 μ m 
in comparison to Fig. 8g. It is evident from the EDS mappings (Fig. 9h) 
that the LaNi5 metal hydride is embedded in the Teflon. Next, the 
elemental compositions of a single metal hydride particle in three sites 
were determined, as shown in Fig. S2, where Table S2 summarizes the 
relevant EDS quantitative results. Since La and Ni appear always in 
combination and with the ratio close to 1 to 5, the main phase after aging 
at 50 ◦C is still LaNi5.
For the material aged at 90 ◦C for 90 days, SE and BSE images in 
Fig. 10a-f illustrate that the size of metal hydride particles decreases, 
and several micro-cracks are present in some particles. The average 
particle size further decreases to 9.06 μ m, as displayed in Fig. 10g. From 
the EDS mappings for the elements of C, F, La, and Ni in Fig. 10h, It is 
evident that the distribution of Ni and La share an abundance of simi­
larities and consistency. The elemental compositions (see Table S3) of 
some selected spots in Fig. S3 also prove that the precipitation of LaH

and Ni did not occur.
The SEM analyses of the material aged at 130 (Fig. 11) and 160 ◦C 
(Fig. 12), similar to the samples aged at 50 and 90 ◦C, present sizes of 
metal hydride particles smaller than that of the as received materials. 
Several cracks in the particles are observed in this case too. Note that the 
average particle sizes for 130 ◦C aged and 160 ◦C aged samples are 10.55 
(Fig. 11g) and 15.59 μ m (see Fig. 12g), respectively. The EDS mappings 
for the elements of C, F, La, and Ni in Fig. 11h and Fig. 12h demonstrate 
that the distributions of these elements are homogeneous. The EDS 
findings for several selected spots for the 130 ◦C aged (Fig. S4 and 
Table S4) and 160 ◦C aged (Fig. S5 and Table S5) samples indicate that 
the overall specimen consists of LaNi5. In summary, micro-cracks were 
detected in the aged samples, but not in the as received material. The 
lattice expansion induced by hydrogenation during aging can be the 
predominant factor for this [18]. Upon hydrogenation, the cell volume 
expansion of LaNi5 can reach values from 20 % up to 27 % [19]. Other 
factors such as temperature and hydrogen pressure can minorly 
contribute to the lattice expansion. As can be seen in Fig. 10f-11f, the 
fracture in the alloy powders is transverse, implying a hydrogenation- 
induced micro-crack mechanism, which is in good agreement with the 
results reported by Kastrissios et al. [20]. It is crucial to note that since 
the hydrogenation does not occur in all locations at the same time, the 
stresses caused by the mismatch between the metal and metal hydride 
matrixes will then cause cracks to form and propagate [20]. The ana­
lyses indicate that within the resolution of SEM, the average particle size 
of the LaNi5 after aging gets smaller than the as received material, 
although it does not linearly depend on the aging temperature. It is 
important to point out that the observed changes are merely a few mi­
crometers, despite SEM analyses revealing that the average particle sizes 
for samples aged at 130 and 160 ◦C (10.55 and 15.59 μm, respectively) 
exceed those of samples aged at 90 ◦C (9.06 μm). The selection of only 
200 particles for quantitative analysis may have contributed to the 
observed discrepancies, as the particle size distribution within the 
sample was not homogeneous. In addition, no phase segregation of 
LaNi5 was observed after aging.
As these results clearly show, the aging process of the samples has 
been accompanied by structural changes at the microscopic level. To 
further detail these changes, the material microstructural features in the 
nanoscale were investigated via the SXAS technique. The experimental 
data and the fitted curves for all samples are shown in Fig. 13a-e, and the 
corresponding size distributions are shown in Fig. 13f-k. For the fitting 
of the scattering curves, a spherical geometry of the particle distribution 
was assumed, as a first approximation. Due to the system’s complexity, 
the particle size distributions were analyzed using SASfit software, 
employing a Log-Normal distribution fitting, which yielded results that 
closely matched the experimental data (Fig. 13). From the size distri­
bution of the samples, we can see a clear trend in the decrement of 
particle sizes with respect to increasing of aging temperatures. The 
average particle sizes, in the observed q-range of the SAXS setup, for the 
as received LaNi5 are roughly 116.6 nm, whereas for those aged at 50, 
90, 130 and 160 ◦C are about 82.3, 58, 54.9 and 38 nm, respectively. The 
particle sizes are significantly reduced with aging, which further sup­
ports the microscopic SEM findings at the nanoscopic scales. Therefore, 
in general, it can be stated that the aging process of the LaNi5 leads to an 
overall structural refinement of the system.
3.4. Aging mechanisms
In this section, the aim is to acquire information on the material 
behavior after a lifetime of 12 years. Therefore, a lifetime model should 
be obtained from the accelerated aging tests. Two essential parameters 
were considered for expressing the hydrogen storage properties of the 
materials. One parameter is the hydrogen storage capacity, reflecting 
the hydrogen content in the metal hydrides, while the other is the

equilibrium dehydrogenation pressure, which reflects the thermody­
namic characteristics of the metal hydrides. First, the plateau capacity 
was taken as one factor and the data aging for 90 days for fitting was 
utilized. In this case, α = ΔCapacity/t, where ΔCapacity is the capacity 
change compared to the original capacity, and t is the aging time. 
Fig. 14a shows the relationship between the aging factor of hydrogen 
storage capacity and the temperature. The linear regression shows that 
the fitted equation is ln(ΔCapacity/t) = 8.77697 −8915.22823/T. 
Therefore, based on this equation, we can calculate that after 12 years, if 
operating at 30 ◦C, ΔCapacity is around 0.152 % of the original plateau 
capacity (0.0016 wt%). In the case of operating at 50 ◦C for 12 years, 
ΔCapacity is around 0.415 % of the original plateau capacity (0.0044 wt 
%).
Secondly, we took the equilibrium pressure for dehydrogenation at 
30 ◦C as one factor and used the data of aging for 90 days for fitting. 
Fig. 14b exhibits the relationship between the aging factor of equilib­
rium pressure for hydrogenation and the temperature. In this case, α =
ΔPeq/t, where ΔPeq is the equilibrium pressure change compared to the 
original value, and t is the aging time. The linear regression shows that 
the fitted equation is ln
(
ΔPeq/t
)
= −2.13849 −4232.96495/T. Based 
on this equation, we can calculate that after 12 years, if operating at 
30 ◦C, ΔPeq for 30 ◦C might decrease around 38.47 % of the original 
equilibrium pressure. If operating at 50 ◦C for 12 years, ΔPeq for 30 ◦C 
might decrease around 91.28 % of the original equilibrium pressure.
From the microstructure characterizations, it is clear that no phase 
segregation was observed after aging. This is quite interesting since, 
according to some earlier research [21], cycling studies indicate that 
phase segregation to LaH and Ni may be the source of the LaNi5 dete­
rioration. Therefore, after careful study, it can be concluded that the 
LaNi5 hydrogen storage properties’ degradation is not related to the 
formation of new phases, which gives a new perspective on the regen­
eration/reactivation of LaNi5. From one point of view, we noticed that 
after aging, the dislocation density increases and particle size decreases, 
indicating that the degradation may mainly come from the nano­
structuring of the materials. The hydrogen pressure stresses the LaNi5 
lattice, which causes the lattice strain to rise. This raises the lattice 
parameter of c, which in turn impacts the concentration of defects, 
primarily dislocation density. It can be observed that the particle size 
also reduces with aging because, after strain accumulates up to a certain 
level, some cracks begin to form in order to release the strain. Even 
though it isn’t included in this study, the findings will make it easier for 
the degraded materials to regenerate or reactivate by applying heat 
treatments to the samples to relieve any remaining strain inside the 
lattice. From another point of view, despite thermodynamic 
expectations, the precipitation of LaH and Ni during aging was not 
observed in this work. However, previous studies have demonstrated 
that the precipitation of LaH and Ni occurs upon thermal or pressure 
cycling [22–26]. This finding can be related to the fact that static con­
ditions were applied in this study (the material was continuously in the 
hydrogenated state). Whereas in the works reported in the literature, by 
extensive cycling, the material has been subjected to continuous 
expansive and contractive forces that locally might have generated 
stresses, which led to the overcoming of the precipitation barrier of LaH 
and Ni. One possible explanation for the degradation of the storage 
capacity is that during aging, the overall hydrogen sites may be lost due 
to samples’ continued cracking, formation of grain boundaries and 
localized amorphization.
4. Conclusions
A series of tests were performed on LaNi5 materials and the results 
obtained from the accelerated aging tests indicate that after 12 years, the 
materials’ capacity degradation lies between around 0.152 % (operating 
at 30 ◦C) and 0.415 % (operating at 50 ◦C) of the original capacity. After 
12 years, the plateau pressure for dehydrogenation at 30 ◦C will 
decrease from around 38.47 % (operating at 30 ◦C) to 91.28 % (oper­
ating at 50 ◦C). No phase segregation was observed after aging but only 
the dislocation density increases and particle size decreases, indicating 
that the degradation may mainly come from the nanostructuring of the 
materials. This work provides some insights into the designing strategies 
for predicting the degradation of the metal hydride’s hydrogen storage 
properties and bodes well for providing practical guidance and methods 
to prolong the metal hydride life for the manufacturers. This work sheds 
light on how to establish approaches for predicting degradation of the 
metal hydrides’ hydrogen storage properties. It also paves the way for 
offering manufacturers useful guidance and strategies to prolong the 
metal hydrides’ life.
