The hydrogen absorption and desorption properties of the Li-Mg-Al-Ti-V and Li-Mg-Al-Ti-Nb lightweight high 
entropy alloys (HEAs) synthesized by mechanical alloying were investigated to develop hydrogen storage alloys 
with high gravimetric capacity. An equiatomic Li20Mg20Al20Ti20V20 consists of two phases; a Ti-V based body- 
centered cubic (BCC) phase and a Li-Mg based BCC phase. The alloy absorbs hydrogen up to H/M = 0.74 
(2.3 wt% H2) at 250 ℃, although the hydrogen absorption and desorption induced phase separation of Mg from 
the Li-Mg based BCC phase. The hydrogen absorption and desorption properties of each Li8Mg8Al28Ti28V28 and 
Li8Mg8Al28Ti28Nb28 single BCC phases were also investigated. At room temperature, they absorbed hydrogen up 
to H/M = 0.43 (1.1 wt% H2) and H/M = 0.68 (1.4 wt% H2), respectively. Unlike Li20Mg20Al20Ti20V20, no clear 
phase separation was observed in these alloys after hydrogen absorption and desorption.
1. Introduction
Hydrogen storage alloys safely store hydrogen in the solid state with 
a small volume and little energy loss [1,2]. However, it is not appro­
priate to use hydrogen storage alloys for a hydrogen tanks in fuel cell 
vehicles because of their low gravimetric capacities. Hydrogen storage 
alloys, such as LaNi5 and TiFe, are mainly used in stationary applications 
such as the storage of hydrogen generated from renewable energy 
sources. However, some alloys, such as Mg-based alloys, have a high 
gravimetric capacity for hydrogen. To date, Mg-based alloys have been 
researched and developed; however, there are still problems with their 
poor kinetics for application in fuel cell vehicles [3,4]. To achieve 
appropriate hydrogen storage alloys for hydrogen tanks in fuel cell ve­
hicles, it is necessary to develop hydrogen storage alloys with not only a 
high gravimetric capacity for hydrogen but also superior kinetics. 
Therefore, it is expected that novel hydrogen storage alloys, that can be 
operated at moderate temperatures with a high gravimetric capacity for 
hydrogen will be developed to apply hydrogen storage alloy to a 
hydrogen tanks in fuel cell vehicles.
In recent years, solid-solution alloys called high entropy alloys 
(HEAs), have attracted attention in many fields owing to their unique 
properties [5–7]. HEAs are composed of multiple elements, typically five 
or more, with similar equiatomic ratios. They are thermodynamically 
stable in the solid solution phase, which is attributed to their high 
mixing entropies. The unique properties of HEAs have been reported in 
the field of hydrogen storage. Despite the consensus that the maximum 
hydrogen content of conventional body centered cubic (BCC) alloys is 
H/M = 2, an HEA with a BCC structure consisting of Ti, V, Zr, Nb, and Hf 
has exceeded H/M = 2 at 299 ◦C [8]. This high hydrogen absorption 
capacity is attributed to large lattice distortions specific to HEAs [8]. 
However, it was also reported that the amount of lattice distortion in 
HEAs does not correlate with their hydrogen absorption capacity [9]. 
Although the relationship between the lattice distortion of HEAs and the 
hydrogen absorption capacity is still under discussion [10], a higher 
hydrogen storage capacity can be expected. The alloy design of HEAs for 
hydrogen storage have been carried out to explore the vast composition 
range by several method, for instance, conventional alloy design as 
typified by alloying hydride and non-hydride forming elements,

machine learning [11,12], and using parameters such as VEC (valence 
electron concentration) and δ (atomic size mismatch) [13]. HEAs 
showed superior hydrogen storage property not only in a single phase 
alloy [14] but also in multi phases alloy [15]. Various types of HEAs 
have been developed with not only increased hydrogen storage capacity 
[8] but also enhanced activation properties [16], low temperature 
dehydrogenation property [15] and other desirable characteristics 
[17–19], such as cycling properties, gravimetric capacity of hydrogen, 
and catalytic effects for hydrogen storage materials.
In this study, the hydrogen absorption and desorption properties of 
Li-Mg-Al-Ti-M based lightweight HEAs, in which light metal elements, 
such as Li and Mg, are favorable for reducing the density, were inves­
tigated to improve their gravimetric capacity. This is because reducing 
the density of the alloy leads to an increase in the gravimetric capacity of 
hydrogen, even though H/M remains the same. Although the number of 
reported research about lightweight HEAs is limited, there is potential in 
lightweight HEAs to improve the gravimetric capacity of hydrogen [10]. 
Studying the research of lightweight HEAs with various compositions 
would be worth for development of hydrogen storage alloy with a high 
gravimetric capacity of hydrogen. Here, the Li-Mg-Al-Ti-M based light­
weight HEAs were synthesized via mechanical alloying (MA) [20]. In a 
previous study, the equiatomic Li20Mg20Al20Ti20M20 system was classi­
fied into four groups based on its crystal structure. The groups are as 
follows: (i) unmixed composites (M = Cr, Mn, Fe), (ii) intermetallic 
compounds (M = Ga, Ge, Sn), (iii) compounds with unidentifiable 
structures (M = Si, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Y, Zn), and (iv) solid solutions (M = V, 
Nb). Equiatomic Li20Mg20Al20Ti20V20 and Li20Mg20Al20Ti20Nb20 consist 
of Ti-V (or Ti-Nb) based BCC and Li-Mg based BCC phases. A single BCC 
phase was obtained in the Li-Mg-Al-Ti-V system by tuning its composi­
tion. Among the Li-Mg-Al-Ti-M based lightweight HEAs, a single BCC 
phases would be also obtained in the Li-Mg-Al-Ti-Nb lightweight HEAs. 
Thus, in this study, equiatomic Li20Mg20Al20Ti20V20, single phases of 
Li-Mg-Al-Ti-V and Li-Mg-Al-Ti-Nb lightweight HEAs were selected to 
evaluate their hydrogen absorption and desorption properties.
2. Experimental procedures
Li20Mg20Al20Ti20V20, Li8Mg8Al28Ti28V28 and Li8Mg8Al28Ti28Nb28 
were synthesized using MA. The detailed sample preparation has been 
described in a previous study [20]. The MA was conducted using a 
planetary ball mill (FRITSCH P-7) with an SKD11 steel vessel and SUJ2 
steel balls. Ball milling was conducted at a rotation speed of 400 rpm 
under 0.1 MPa Ar atmosphere. The ball-to-sample mass ratio was 96:1. 
The milling process was repeated 40 times, and the sample was milled 
for 20 h. Each process involved rotation for 30 min between 15 min 
pauses to prevent excessive heating of the sample. All the sample 
preparations were performed under an Ar atmosphere (oxygen con­
centration less than 1 ppm) within a glove box (Miwa Manufacturing 
DBO-2LNKP-MM01) to reduce the effects of oxidation as much as 
possible.
Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC, RIGAKU DSC8230HP) was 
performed under 0.1 or 0.3 MPa H2 atmosphere up to 400 ◦C with 
heating rate of 2 ◦C/min to determine the temperature for PCT (pressure 
composition temperature(isotherm)) measurement. Before the mea­
surements, Li20Mg20Al20Ti20V20 was activated at 1.0 MPa H2 by heating 
up to 350 ℃ and cooling down to room temperature with a heating/ 
cooling rate of 2 ℃/min in the DSC equipment. PCT measurements were 
performed at room temperature and 250 ◦C by Sieverts-type equipment 
without any activation processes, including both pre hydrogenation/ 
dehydrogenation and vacuuming under high temperatures. Hydrogen 
absorption kinetics of Li8Mg8Al28Ti28Nb28 were examined under 
2.0 MPa H2 at room temperature using Sieverts-type equipment without 
any activation processes. After the hydrogen absorption kinetics mea­
surement, the hydrogen desorption property of Li8Mg8Al28Ti28Nb28 was 
evaluated by thermogravimetric and differential thermal analyses (TG- 
DTA, Bruker 2000SA) using a heating rate of 5 ◦C/min in He flow up to 
500 ◦C in a glove box. The crystal structure of the phases in the samples 
was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku SmartLab (Cu Kα1) 
and RINT-2500V (Cu Kα)). The XRD measurements were performed 
without exposing the samples to air by covering them with a polyimide 
film. Scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM, FEI Titan3 G2 
60–300) observation was conducted to evaluate the microstructures 
without exposing the samples to air by using non atmosphere exposed 
STEM holder. The STEM samples were fabricated to thin film from 
powder using focused ion beam (FIB). The pickup process was per­
formed by FIB (Hitachi High-Tech FB-2100) and the thinning process 
was performed by FIB- scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM, JEOL 
JIB-4600F/HKD). Both FIB fabrications were conducted without 
exposing the samples to air by using non atmosphere exposed holder. 
The sample transfer of holder to holder was conducted in the glove box, 
so the samples were not exposed to air.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Hydrogen absorption and desorption property of equiatomic 
Li20Mg20Al20Ti20V20
XRD measurements were performed to confirm the crystal structures 
of the phases formed in the synthesized alloy. The top row of Fig. 1
shows the XRD pattern of equiatomic Li20Mg20Al20Ti20V20 synthesized 
by MA. Diffraction peaks corresponding to the BCC phase and an addi­
tional peak are observed. The lattice constant of the main BCC phase was 
a= 3.175 Å, which is almost same as that of equiatomic TiV solid so­
lution at a= 3.165 Å [21]. Hence, the main BCC phase (labeled with 
circles) was assigned as a Ti-V based BCC solid solution. However, an 
additional peak located at approximately 36 ◦, which was not identified 
as the Ti-V phase, was also observed in Fig. 1. Assuming that this peak 
corresponds to a BCC phase, its lattice constant was calculated to be a=
3.522 Å. This is close to that of equiatomic LiMg solid solution at a=
3.484 Å [22]. Because Li and Mg are immiscible with Ti and V in the 
equilibrium state, the small peak (labeled with a star) was probably a 
Li-Mg based BCC solid solution that did not dissolve into the Ti-V phase. 
Because the lattice constant of the Li-Mg based solid solution was 
smaller than that of equiatomic LiMg solid solution, the composition of 
the Li-Mg base solid solution might not be equiatomic, or some elements 
might be dissolved into the Li-Mg phase. We could not distinguish be­
tween the Ti-V and Li-Mg based phases using conventional SEM-energy 
dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) observations in previous study [20]. 
Considering SEM-EDS result and broad peaks in the XRD, Ti-V based 
phase and Li-Mg based phase would be fine distributed. For equiatomic 
Li20Mg20Al20Ti20V20, it was shown that two BCC phases, which were

Ti-V based, and Li-Mg based solid solutions, were synthesized by MA, 
similar to a previous study [20].
Next, the hydrogen absorption and desorption properties of equia­
tomic Li20Mg20Al20Ti20V20 were investigated using DSC and PCT mea­
surements. The DSC experiment, which was performed in 0.1 MPa H2 
atmosphere from room temperature to 500 ◦C after activated, indicated 
that equiatomic Li20Mg20Al20Ti20V20 absorbs and desorbs hydrogen at 
approximately 250 ◦C (Figure S1, in supplementary material). Fig. 2
shows the PCT curve of equiatomic Li20Mg20Al20Ti20V20 measured at 
250 ◦C. Regarding the absorption process, a plateau region was 
observed at 0.04–0.10 MPa, and the plateau range was H/M = 0.37. The 
maximum hydrogen absorption of Li20Mg20Al20Ti20V20 reached H/M =
0.74, which corresponds to 2.3 wt% H2. On the other hand, in the 
desorbing process, a plateau region was observed at 0.02–0.03 MPa, and 
the plateau range was H/M = 0.23. The H/M after PCT was approxi­
mately 0.4. Regarding to the hydrogen desorption of Li20Mg20Al20­
Ti20V20, the plateau pressure of equiatomic Li20Mg20Al20Ti20V20 was 
almost comparable to that of ball-milled pure Mg [23]. As shown in 
Fig. 1, a Mg phase with a hexagonal close-packed (HCP) appeared, and 
the Li-Mg BCC phase disappeared in the XRD pattern after the PCT 
measurement, although no significant changes were observed in the 
peaks of Ti-V phase. These suggest that Mg would separate from the 
Li-Mg phase during the hydrogen absorption and desorption processes. 
This is consistent with a previous report that MgH2 formed in the AZ31 
alloy with 15 wt% Li, which consists of the BCC phase, due to hydrogen 
absorption [24]. Thus, the plateau pressure of the absorption process 
would be attributed to the formation of MgH2 from the Li-Mg phase. 
Assuming that all Mg in Li20Mg20Al20Ti20V20 forms MgH₂, the hydrogen 
absorption amount of Li20Mg20Al20Ti20V20 should be H/M = 0.4. This 
H/M value is slightly larger than that of plateau region of the absorption 
process (H/M = 0.37). Therefore, most of the Mg in Li20Mg20Al20Ti20V20 
could form MgH2 in the hydrogen absorption process.
Herein, the crystal structure of Li20Mg20Al20Ti20V20 and the lattice 
constants of the phases observed before and after PCT measurements are 
discussed. While the XRD profile before the PCT measurement showed 
two BCC phases with Ti-V and Li-Mg based phases in Li20Mg20Al20­
Ti20V20, Ti-V based BCC and Mg HCP phases were identified after the 
PCT measurement. The lattice constant of the Mg HCP phase in Li20M­
g20Al20Ti20V20 and that of pure Mg were a= 3.209 Å, c= 5.211 Å and a=
3.214 Å, c= 5.219 Å, respectively. Because the atomic radius of Li 
(152 pm) is smaller than that of Mg (160 pm), a part of Li might be 
solved in Mg phase. However, equiatomic LiMg phase is BCC, all Li in the 
Li-Mg phase were not solved into the Mg phase. Considering the 
disappearance of the Li-Mg phase and the appearance of the Mg phase by 
hydrogen absorption and desorption processes, the phase separation of 
Li from the Li-Mg phase could occur as well as Mg. In contrast, the Ti-V 
base BCC phase was identified both before and after the PCT measure­
ment. The lattice constants for these were a= 3.175 Å and a= 3.204 Å, 
respectively. This small expansion of the lattice constant of Ti-V based 
BCC after the PCT measurement would be due to the remaining 
hydrogen solute. If the expansion of the lattice constant of Ti-V based 
BCC is entirely due to hydrogen occupation, the amount of hydrogen is 
H/M = 0.14–0.23. This H/M was calculated from that the volume 
expansion is 2.9 ± 0.3 Å3 per hydrogen atom in the T-site of d-band 
metals and 2.2 ± 0.3 Å3 per hydrogen atom in the O-site of d-band 
metals [25]. The H/M = 0.14–0.23 calculated from the lattice volume 
expansion was not consistent with the remaining hydrogen in Li20M­
g20Al20Ti20V20 after the PCT measurement, which is H/M = 0.38. If Li in 
Li20Mg20Al20Ti20V20 forms LiH upon hydrogen absorption, the hydrogen 
in LiH remains even after the PCT measurement at 250 ◦C because LiH 
requires high temperature for hydrogen desorption, such as 710 ◦C in

5 × 10-3MPa [26]. In this case, the sum of the hydrogen amount of LiH 
(H/M ≦ 0.2) and that calculated from the lattice volume expansion of 
the Ti-V based BCC phase (H/M = 0.14–0.23) is almost equivalent to the 
remaining H/M = 0.38. Therefore, the Li in Li20Mg20Al20Ti20V20 may 
form independent LiH upon hydrogen absorption. This hypothesis does 
not contradict with that Mg forms MgH2 following formation of LiH at 
hydrogen absorption process in Li-Mg alloy which consists of BCC phase 
[27]. Li20Mg20Al20Ti20V20 would absorb hydrogen through the 
hydrogen solution into the Ti-V based BCC phase and the formation of 
MgH2 and LiH from the Li-Mg based BCC phase.
Although Li20Mg20Al20Ti20V20 absorbed and desorbed hydrogen, 
applying Li20Mg20Al20Ti20V20 to hydrogen storage alloys was chal­
lenging. One of these challenges was the phase separation caused by 
hydrogen absorption and desorption; the Li-Mg based BCC phase dis­
appeared and the Mg HCP phase appeared, resulting in an irreversible 
reaction. However, no clear phase separation was observed in the Ti-V 
based BCC phase in Li20Mg20Al20Ti20V20, even after hydrogen

absorption and desorption, as shown by the XRD spectra. Therefore, we 
focused on lightweight HEAs with Ti-V based BCC single phase to sup­
press phase separation.
3.2. Hydrogen absorption and desorption property of single BCC phase 
Li8Mg8Al28Ti28V28
The hydrogen absorption and desorption properties of a single Ti-V 
based BCC phase were investigated to suppress the phase separation. 
Li8Mg8Al28Ti28V28, consisting of a single BCC phase, was synthesized by 
MA, same as previous study [20] as shown in the top row of Fig. 3. Only 
the peaks from the BCC phase were observed in the XRD pattern. 
Because the lattice constant was close to that of the Ti-V based BCC 
phase in Li20Mg20Al20Ti20V20, the peaks (labeled with circles) were 
assigned to a BCC structure corresponding to the Ti-V based solid 
solution. The lattice constants of the BCC phase in the top row of Fig. 3
(a) and (b) are a = 3.177 Å and 3.175 Å, respectively. Because the 
sample was synthesized by MA, these lattice constants differed slightly 
from batch to batch. This lattice constant difference is negligible in 
terms of the hydrogen absorption and desorption properties. Although 
the Li-Mg phase was formed in equiatomic Li20Mg20Al20Ti20V20, it was 
not observed in Li8Mg8Al28Ti28V28. This suggests the presence of smaller 
amounts of Li and Mg solutes in the Ti-V based BCC phase of 
Li8Mg8Al28Ti28V28.
Next, the hydrogen absorption and desorption properties of Li8M­
g8Al28Ti28V28 with a single BCC phase were investigated using DSC and 
PCT measurements. The DSC experiment, which was performed in a 
0.3 MPa H2 atmosphere from room temperature to 500 ◦C, indicated 
that Li8Mg8Al28Ti28V28 absorbed hydrogen close to room temperature 
(Figure S2, in Supplementary material). Fig. 4(a) shows the PCT curve of 
Li8Mg8Al28Ti28V28 measured at room temperature. Similar to the DSC 
data, the PCT curve showed that Li8Mg8Al28Ti28V28 absorbed hydrogen 
at room temperature in the amount of H/M = 0.43, which corresponds 
to 1.1 wt% H2. In the PCT curve, no clear plateau region is observed, and 
almost no hydrogen is desorbed at room temperature. XRD measure­
ment was performed after the PCT measurement to investigate the effect 
of hydrogen absorption on the phase stability. As shown in Fig. 3(a), 
only the BCC phase was observed in Li8Mg8Al28Ti28V28 after the PCT 
measurement. The XRD results suggested that no clear phase separation 
occurred in Li8Mg8Al28Ti28V28 after hydrogen absorption. The diffrac­
tion peaks of the BCC phase shifted to the lower 2θ angle side compared 
with that before PCT measurement. The estimated lattice constant of the 
BCC phase after the PCT measurement was a = 3.204 Å, which was 
slightly larger than that before PCT. This lattice expansion would be due 
to the hydrogen absorption. Based on the XRD results and PCT curve, the 
BCC phase of Li8Mg8Al28Ti28V28 could absorb hydrogen in the solid 
solute state at room temperature.
Because phase separation was not observed in Li8Mg8Al28Ti28V28 
upon hydrogenation at room temperature, PCT measurements were 
performed at 250 ◦C. As shown in Fig. 4(b), the maximum H/M reached 
1.14, which corresponds to 3.0 wt% H2. In the PCT curve, no clear 
plateau region was observed at 250 ◦C. On the other hand, hydrogen 
desorption was observed at 250 ◦C. The amount of hydrogen desorbed 
was H/M = 0.80, which corresponds to 2.1 wt% H2 at 250 ◦C. XRD was 
performed on Li8Mg8Al28Ti28V28 after the PCT measurements to inves­
tigate the effects of hydrogen absorption and desorption on the phase 
transformation. As shown in Fig. 3(b), only the BCC phase was observed 
in Li8Mg8Al28Ti28V28 after the PCT measurement. The peak of the BCC 
phase shifted to the lower 2θ angle side compared with that before the 
PCT measurement, and the lattice constant of the BCC phase after the 
PCT measurement was a = 3.196 Å which is smaller than that after PCT 
measurement at room temperature. This must come from the different 
residual hydrogen amounts. PCT and XRD results indicated that Li8M­
g8Al28Ti28V28 could absorb and desorb hydrogen without clear phase 
separation.
3.3. Hydrogen absorption and desorption property of single BCC phase 
Li8Mg8Al28Ti28Nb28
Although Li8Mg8Al28Ti28V28 absorbed hydrogen at room tempera­
ture, the hydrogen absorption amount was not so much. Therefore, V 
was changed to Nb as a constituent of the lightweight HEAs to improve 
hydrogen absorption. Because Nb has a higher affinity for hydrogen than 
V, the lightweight HEAs, including Nb might have a larger hydrogen 
absorption H/M than V, even though Nb has a higher density. Li8M­
g8Al28Ti28Nb28 was synthesized by MA, and the top row of Fig. 5 shows 
the XRD pattern. Only the diffraction peaks corresponding to the BCC 
phase were observed. The peaks (labeled with circles) were assigned as a 
Ti-Nb based BCC solid solution, and the lattice constant was a = 3.271 Å. 
A single BCC phase was synthesized in the Li-Mg-Al-Ti-Nb system, 
similar to the Li-Mg-Al-Ti-V system. The lattice constant of

Li8Mg8Al28Ti28Nb28 is larger than that of Li8Mg8Al28Ti28V28 because the 
atomic radius of Nb (143 pm) is larger than that of V (132 pm).
Next, the hydrogen absorption and desorption properties of Li8M­
g8Al28Ti28Nb28 with a single BCC phase were investigated using DSC and 
PCT measurements. The DSC experiment, which was performed in a 
0.3 MPa H2 atmosphere from room temperature to 500 ◦C, indicated 
that Li8Mg8Al28Ti28Nb28 could absorb hydrogen close to room temper­
ature (Figure S3, in supplementary material). Fig. 6 shows the PCT curve 
of Li8Mg8Al28Ti28Nb28 measured at room temperature. The amount of 
absorbed hydrogen at room temperature was H/M = 0.68, which cor­
responds to 1.4 wt% H2. In the PCT curve, no clear plateau region is 
observed, and almost no hydrogen is desorbed at room temperature. As 
shown in Fig. 5, only the BCC phase was observed in Li8Mg8Al28Ti28Nb28 
after the PCT measurement. In other words, no clear phase separation 
was observed in the XRD pattern of Li8Mg8Al28Ti28Nb28 after hydrogen 
absorption. The peaks of the BCC phase shifted to the lower 2θ angle side 
compared to that before the PCT measurement. The lattice constant of 
the BCC phase after the PCT measurement was a = 3.348 Å. The lattice 
constant would expand due to hydrogen absorption.
The hydrogen absorption kinetics at room temperature and hydrogen 
desorption upon heating of Li8Mg8Al28Ti28Nb28 were examined, because 
the hydrogen absorption amount of Li8Mg8Al28Ti28Nb28 was larger than 
that of Li8Mg8Al28Ti28V28 at room temperature. First, the hydrogen 
absorption kinetics of Li8Mg8Al28Ti28Nb28 were examined under 
2.0 MPa H2 at room temperature, as shown in Fig. 7. The alloy absorbed 
hydrogen up to H/M = 0.65. The amount of hydrogen absorbed in the 
hydrogen absorption kinetics test was comparable to that observed in 
the PCT measurements. In the absorption curve, no obvious incubation 
period was observed though this was the first cycle of hydrogen ab­
sorption/desorption without any activation processes. Because the al­
loys synthesized by MA had already activated the surface, no obvious 
incubation period would be observed. The alloy required more than ten 
hours to saturate hydrogen absorption. The hydrogen absorption ki­
netics of Li8Mg8Al28Ti28Nb28 were relatively slower than those of pre­
viously reported Li-containing lightweight HEAs [28].
The hydrogen desorption properties of Li8Mg8Al28Ti28Nb28 were 
examined using TG-DTA. Because Li8Mg8Al28Ti28Nb28 desorbed almost 
no hydrogen at room temperature, TG-DTA was performed to 
Fig. 10. STEM-EDS images of Li8Mg8Al28Ti28Nb28 (a) before hydrogenated (as-MA) (b) after hydrogenated.

investigate its hydrogen desorption properties. Fig. 8 shows the TG-DTA 
results. It indicates that the alloy desorbed hydrogen at H/M = 0.59 
(1.2 wt% H2) up to 500 ◦C as an endothermic reaction. The hydrogen 
absorption amount was almost consistent with the hydrogen desorption 
amount in the TG, thereby Li8Mg8Al28Ti28Nb28 would desorb almost all 
hydrogen up to 500 ◦C. The hydrogen desorption temperature of Li8M­
g8Al28Ti28Nb28 would be almost comparable to that of currently re­
ported lightweight HEAs. The range of main hydrogen desorption 
temperatures of lightweight HEAs is 200–400 ◦C for most alloys, as 
previously reported [28–35]. As shown in Fig. 9, the XRD results showed 
that only the BCC phase was observed in all states of Li8Mg8Al28­
Ti28Nb28: as-MA, after hydrogen absorption, and after hydrogen 
desorption. The lattice constant of the as-MA, the hydrogenated and 
dehydrogenated states were a = 3.266, 3.341, and 3.254 Å, respectively. 
These results indicate that Li8Mg8Al28Ti28Nb28 could absorb and desorb 
hydrogen without clear phase separation, because new phases were not 
observed even after hydrogen absorption and desorption. Interestingly 
the lattice constant of the dehydrogenated Li8Mg8Al28Ti28Nb28 was 
smaller than that of as-MA. This difference in the lattice constants 
cannot be explained by considering only the shrinkage of the lattice 
constants owing to hydrogen desorption. One of the possible reasons for 
this could be the compositional change of the metal elements upon local 
microscopic segregation.
The microstructures of Li8Mg8Al28Ti28Nb28 before and after hydro­
genated were evaluated using STEM-EDS and the images are shown in 
Fig. 10. Constituent elements, except for Li which cannot be detected 
conventional EDS, are distributed almost uniform both before (Fig. 10
(a)) and after hydrogenation (Fig. 10 (b)). There were no significant 
differences between the microstructures before and after hydrogenation 
based on Bright Field (BF) and High Angle Annular Dark Field (HAADF) 
images. These results are consistent with the other experimental results, 
which show that Li8Mg8Al28Ti28Nb28 absorbs hydrogen without clear 
phase separation.
The hydrogen absorption amounts of Li8Mg8Al28Ti28V28 and Li8M­
g8Al28Ti28Nb28 were H/M = 0.43–1.14 and did not reach that of 
TiVZrNbHf (H/M = 2.5) [8]. One possible reason why the lightweight 
HEAs in this study does not exhibit such a high hydrogen storage ca­
pacity may be the high Al content in alloys composition. It has been 
reported in literature that hydrogen absorption decreases with 
increasing Al content in BCC alloys [36–38]. Therefore, tuning the 
chemical composition may be effective for improving the amount of 
hydrogen absorbed. However, the gravimetric hydrogen capacity of the 
alloys (1.1–3.0 wt% H2) were not far from that of TiVZrNbHf (2.7 wt% 
H2) [8] due to the low density of these alloys. The calculated densities of 
for the Li8Mg8Al28Ti28V28, Li8Mg8Al28Ti28Nb28, and TiVZrNbHf alloys 
were 3.7, 4.5, 8.9 g/cm3, respectively. If the H/M of these alloys can be 
improved to 2, the gravimetric hydrogen capacity could exceed 5 wt% 
H2 due to the low density of these alloys. Furthermore, these alloys can 
absorb hydrogen at room temperature without activation process. 
Although there are several challenges currently, such as low H/M and 
high desorption temperature, this study showed that lightweight HEAs 
are worth researching for hydrogen storage alloy. The ultimate goal of 
our research is to apply lightweight HEAs to hydrogen tanks in fuel cell 
vehicles, so the hydrogen absorption and desorption properties of the 
lightweight HEAs should be improved in the future work.
4. Conclusion
In this study, the applicability of Li-Mg-Al-Ti-V and Li-Mg-Al-Ti-Nb 
based lightweight HEAs as hydrogen-storage alloys was investigated. 
The hydrogen absorption and desorption properties of Li20Mg20Al20­
Ti20V20, Li8Mg8Al28Ti28V28 and Li8Mg8Al28Ti28Nb28 were presented. 
Equiatomic Li20Mg20Al20Ti20V20 consisted of two phases; Ti-V based 
BCC phase and Li-Mg based BCC phase. Li20Mg20Al20Ti20V20 absorbed 
hydrogen up to H/M = 0.74 (2.3 wt% H2) at 250 ◦C. In this absorption 
process, MgH2 and LiH formed from the Li-Mg BCC phase. This 
precipitated Mg phase mainly contributed to reversible hydrogenation 
reaction. Li8Mg8Al28Ti28V28 and Li8Mg8Al28Ti28Nb28 consisted of a 
single BCC phase that absorbed hydrogen at H/M = 0.43 (1.1 wt% H2) 
and H/M = 0.68 (1.4 wt% H2), respectively, at room temperature 
without clear phase separation. Furthermore, Li8Mg8Al28Ti28Nb28 des­
orbed almost all hydrogen up to 500 ◦C without clear phase separation. 
Although the gravimetric hydrogen capacities of studied Li8Mg8Al28­
Ti28V28 and Li8Mg8Al28Ti28Nb28 are not sufficiently large, lightweight 
HEAs would have the potential for their application in fuel cell vehicle 
tanks.
