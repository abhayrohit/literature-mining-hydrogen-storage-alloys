Abstract 
Catalytic doping of magnesium hydride (MgH2 ) to improve its hydrogen ab/desorption kinetic properties is considered to be an effective 
and feasible method. In solid-phase catalysis, the extent of contact between the catalyst and the substrate determines the catalytic reaction 
in a great sense. With large speciﬁc surface area and abundant active sites, two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials are promising catalysts 
for MgH2 via providing numerous pathways for the diffusion and dissociation of hydrogen. In this regard, 2D NiMn-based layered double 
hydroxide and layered metallic oxide (LMO) are designed and introduced into MgH2 to improve its hydrogen storage properties. Simultaneous 
enhancement in interfacial contact, desorption temperature and kinetics are achieved. The MgH2 + 9wt% Ni3 Mn-LMO composites begin to 
discharge hydrogen at only 190 °C and 6.10wt% H2 could be charged in 600 s at 150 °C. The activation energy for de/hydrogenation is 
reduced by 42.43% and 46.56%, respectively, compared to pure MgH2 . Even at a low operating temperature of 235 °C, the modiﬁed system 
was still able to release 4.44wt% H2 in an hour, which has rarely been reported in previous studies. Microstructure observations and density 
functional theory calculations revealed that ﬁrst, the hydrogen pumping effect of Mg2 Ni/Mg2 NiH4 promotes the adsorption and desorption 
of hydrogen molecules on the surface of MgH2 , second, MnOx drew electrons from Mg2 Ni, producing a new Density of State structure 
with a lower d-bond center. This unique change further strengthens the Mg2 Ni/Mg2 NiH4 pump effect on MgH2 . Our work indicates that 
the application of 2D metal-based catalysts is a feasible and promising approach towards MgH2 for solid-state hydrogen storage to meet 
technical and scientiﬁc requirements.

1. Introduction 
The demand for clean energy has been increasing due to 
the depletion of fossil resources and growing environmental 
concerns. Hydrogen energy has attracted widespread attention 
because of its high combustion caloriﬁc value and abundant

sources [ 1-3 ]. Especially, the storage of hydrogen is crucial 
for its critical role in bridging hydrogen production and ap- 
plication [ 4 , 5 ]. Due to the excellent volumetric density (110.0 
kg ·m−3 ) and gravimetric hydrogen density (7.6wt%), MgH2 
has been widely investigated as a safe and efﬁcient solid- 
state hydrogen storage material [ 6 , 7 ]. However, strong metal- 
hydrogen bonds and kinetic barriers restricted its further de- 
velopment and practical applications [ 8 ]. To address the above 
challenges, researchers have investigated various strategies to 
enhance the hydrogen storage capability of MgH2 . Nanotech- 
nology [ 9 , 10 ], alloying [ 11 , 12 ], and compositing [ 13 , 14 ] are

demonstrated to effectively enhance the hydrogen storage per- 
formance. 
Catalytic modiﬁcation is also adopted as a feasible ap- 
proach to improve the kinetic properties of MgH2 by 
reducing the energy barrier for hydrogen ab/desorption 
[ 15-17 ]. Recently, the emergence of transition metal hy- 
droxides/oxides with uniform distribution of active sites and 
the ability to undergo fast and reversible redox reactions 
lights great hope for pushing the performance of MgH2 
into advanced levels [ 18-21 ]. In our previous study [ 22 ], 
MOF-supported Nb2 O5 nanoparticles were designed and the 
MgH2 + 7wt%Nb2 O5 @MOF could release 6.2wt% hydrogen 
in 2.6 min at 275 °C. Samuel [ 23 ] et al. introduced Ni6 MnO8 
into MgH2 by ball milling, and the multivalent state changes 
of Ni and Mn during hydrogen absorption and desorption 
were considered to be an essential factor in improving the 
hydrogen storage properties of MgH2 . Meng [ 24 ] et al. 
synthesized V4 Nb18 O55 microspheres composed of tens of 
nanometer-sized nanoparticles, the distinctive molecular-scale 
Nb/V interface largely reduced the dehydrogenation energy 
barrier of MgH2 . Such oxides would be reduced to low- 
valent metal oxides or even zero-valent metals during the 
MgH2 hydrogen storage process, resulting in a multi-element 
or multi-valent chemical environment. Separately, Large spe- 
ciﬁc surface area is assumed to be important for the cat- 
alytic efﬁciency of dehydrogenation and hydrogenation. For 
example, Chen [ 25 ] et al. synthesized graphene-like TiO2 
(B) nanosheets with a monoclinic structure, the metallic Ti 
nanoparticles and wrinkled Ti2 O3 generated during the hy- 
drogen adsorption and desorption process created numerous 
boundary interfaces between MgH2 and the catalysts to fa- 
cilitate the hydrogen diffusion. Xian [ 26 ] et al. prepared a 
2D bimetallic oxide TiNb2 O7 , which enabled MgH2 to emit 
7.0wt% H2 when heated to 300 °C and a capacity retention 
of as high as 96% was achieved after 30 cycles. Furthermore, 
Ni is generally considered to react with Mg/MgH2 to form 
Mg2 Ni/Mg2 NiH4 during hydrogen uptake and release to lower 
the reaction barrier. On the other hand. Mn can easily form 
different oxides on the catalyst surface and undergo reversible 
transformation between different oxidation states, participat- 
ing in the redox reaction and improving the catalytic activity. 
Two-dimensional layered compounds are known as layered 
double hydroxides (LDHs) [ 27-29 ]. Heat treatment of LDHs 
can obtained corresponding metal oxides (layered metal ox- 
ides, LMOs) with an enlarged high active surface area while 
maintaining the original layered structure [ 30-32 ]. Inspired 
by the abundance of active sites in high speciﬁc surface area 
of 2D materials, the multivalent chemical environments of 
the oxides, and efﬁcient catalysis by Ni and Mn, we pre- 
pared NiMn-LDH by a hydrothermal method, and NiMn- 
LMO was obtained by additional heat treatment. As expected, 
both of them improved the hydrogen storage performance 
of MgH2 , and kinetic analyses demonstrated that the cat- 
alytic performance of LMO was better than that of LDH. 
Microscopic characterization revealed that the generation of 
Mg2 Ni/Mg2 NiH4 , and the multivalent changes of Mn syner- 
gistically improved the performance of MgH2 . 
2. Results and discussion 
2.1. Microstructure of Ni3 Mn-LDH and NiMn-LMO 
The synthetic procedure of Ni3 Mn-LDH and Ni3 Mn-LMO 
is illustrated in Fig. 1 (a). The XRD patterns of Nix Mn-LDH 
( x = 1, 2, 3) are shown in Fig. 1 (b) and Fig. S1. The crystal 
structures of NiMn-LDH prepared by one-step hydrothermal 
method are all consistent with those reported in the literature 
[ 33 ], indicating the successful preparation of NiMn-LDH. The 
diffraction peaks at 37.32 °, 43.36 ° and 62.99 ° of Ni3 Mn-LMO 
prepared after annealing treatment under argon atmosphere 
can be attributed to the (111), (210), and (220) faces of NiO 
(JCPDS No 75-0197). The remaining four diffraction peaks 
can be assigned to the (111), (220), (311), and (511) crys- 
tal planes of NiMn2 O4 (JCPDS No 01-1110), which demon- 
strates that the annealed sample is composed of NiO and 
NiMn2 O4 composite metallic oxides. Besides, the Rietveld 
reﬁnement result of Ni3 Mn-LMO revealed that the mass per- 
centage of NiO and NiMn2 O4 are 88.9wt% and 11.1wt%, 
respectively. The transformation of Ni3 Mn-LDH into Ni3 Mn- 
LMO via pyrolysis is further conﬁrmed by Raman spec- 
troscopy (Fig. S2). Ni3 Mn-LDH exhibited Raman peaks typi- 
cal of those belonging to LDH. While Ni3 Mn-LMO exhibited 
ﬁrst-order and second-order optical phonon peaks character- 
ized at ≈565–616 and 1100 cm−1 , respectively, indicating the 
presence of NiO [ 34 ]. The chemical compositions and bind- 
ing states of different atoms of the prepared Ni3 Mn-LDH and 
Ni3 Mn-LMO were analyzed by XPS as shown in Figs. S5, 
S6. The spectral peaks of C 1s, O 1s, Ni 2p, and Mn 2p can 
be observed from Fig. S5. Figure S6 (a) shows two major spin 
orbitals in the high-resolution Ni 2p spectra of 856.1 eV and 
873.7 eV, which are attributed to the Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2 
binding energy of Ni. The spin energy interval is 17.6 eV, 
indicating that Ni2 + is in an oxidized state in both Ni3 Mn- 
LDH and Ni3 Mn-LMO [ 40 ]. The Mn 2p spectrum is shown 
in Fig. S6 (b) and consists of two main peaks, the 2p3/2 and 
2p1/2 spin orbitals at 643.4 eV and 654.8 eV, respectively. 
In addition, the presence of three different oxidation states 
of Mn in both Ni3 Mn-LDH and Ni3 Mn-LMO can be ob- 
tained by using XPS split-peak ﬁtting [ 44 ]. Therefore, it can 
be hypothesized that the presence of various valence forms 
of Mn may be beneﬁcial for the hydrogen ab/desorption of 
MgH2 . 
To conﬁrm the geometric morphology of Ni3 Mn-LDH and 
Ni3 Mn-LMO, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) are em- 
ployed in Fig. 1 (d) and Fig. 1 (e). It is obvious that the as- 
synthesized Ni3 Mn-LDH presents a hierarchical structure con- 
sisting of 2D layered nanosheets. SEM images of NiMn-LDH 
with different Ni/Mn ratios also showed the same geometri- 
cal shape (Fig. S3, S4). TEM images of Ni3 Mn-LDH simi- 
larly indicate ultrathin lattice structures ( Fig. 2 A (a, b)). As 
shown in Fig. 2 A (c), the high-resolution transmission elec- 
tron microscopy (HRTEM) image of Ni3 Mn-LDH exhibits a 
d spacing of 0.23 nm for the lattice stripes, which can be re- 
ferred to selected regions of the (015) plane of Ni3Mn-LDH. 
The electron diffraction (SAED) image ( Fig. 2 A (e)) shows

the reﬂected rings in the (110) and (015) planes of Ni3 Mn- 
LDH. The EDS mapping results in Fig. 1 d further conﬁrm the 
uniform distribution of Ni, Mn and O in Ni3 Mn-LDH. After 
heat treatment, Ni3 Mn-LMO maintained the layered structure 
( Fig. 1 (e)). The removal of water molecules and anions be- 
tween the LDH layers [ 35 ] leads to a lower degree of aggrega- 
tion and thickness of the nanosheets and more surface defects. 
TEM images of Ni3 Mn-LMO similarly show that the lami- 
nar structure was preserved Fig. 2 B (a, b). From Fig. 2 B (c), 
lattice stripes with plane spacing of 0.208 nm and 0.253 nm 
corresponding to the (200) plane of NiO and (311) plane of 
NiMn2 O4 are clearly observed, which is consistent with the 
XRD results. The SAED image ( Fig. 2 B (e)) further demon- 
strates that the (111), (222) planes of NiO and the (400), 
(440) planes of NiMn2 O4 . 400), (440) planes. In addition, the 
EDS mapping in Fig. 2 B (d) also demonstrated that Ni, Mn 
and O were equally uniformly distributed in the Ni3 Mn-LMO 
catalyst. In addition, the N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms 
(Fig. S7(a), Supporting Information) of both Ni3 Mn-LDH and 
Ni3 Mn-LMO are of typical iv-type, indicating the presence of 
meso– and micropores. Fig. S7(b) demonstrates the pore size 
distribution curves of Ni3 Mn-LDH and Ni3 Mn-LMO, and it is 
clear that Ni3 Mn-LMO produces more pore structures, lead- 
ing to an increase in speciﬁc surface area. Some of these pore 
structures were generated by the conversion of stripped CO3 2−
to CO2 under thermal treatment [ 31 ], indicating the genera- 
tion of more catalytically active sites. The speciﬁc surface 
area and pore volume data calculated based on the Brunauer- 
Emmett - Teller (BET) method is summarized in Table S1. 
Hereby, Ni3 Mn-LDH and Ni3 Mn-LMO composed of ultrathin 
nanosheets were successfully fabricated, which might provide 
a larger speciﬁc surface area and more catalytically active 
sites for hydrogen storage in MgH2 [ 36 ]. 
2.2. Effect of NiMn-LDH and NiMn-LMO nanosheets on the 
dehydrogenation reaction of MgH2 
According to the non-isothermal hydrogen desorption 
curves in Fig. 3 (a) and Fig. S9, the dynamic properties are all 
substantially improved as a result of catalyst addition. After 
considering both the amount of hydrogen release and the on- 
set of dehydrogenation temperature, we selected a 9wt% addi- 
tion ratio for the following experiments. The dehydrogenation 
temperature curves of the MgH2 system with different molar 
ratio of Ni2 + /Mn2 + additions reveal that the onset and ter- 
minal dehydrogenation temperatures of the modiﬁed MgH2 
system were all greatly reduced. Speciﬁcally, as the molar 
ratio of Ni2 + increases, the onset dehydrogenation tempera- 
ture of MgH2 decreases gradually and the dehydrogenation 
rate is accelerated. Of these, MgH2 + 9wt% Ni3 Mn-LDH has 
the lowest onset dehydrogenation temperature with the most 
rapid dehydrogenation rate. It started discharging at 210 °C, 
which is 140 °C lower than the pristine MgH2 , and can dis- 
charge 6.63wt% of H2 at 350 °C, where pure MgH2 only 
began to release hydrogen. After annealing, the Ni3 Mn-LMO 
further reduced the starting dehydrogenation temperature of 
MgH2 to 190 °C and the dehydrogenation rate was ulteriorly 
accelerated ( Fig. 3 (b)).

elemental mapping (d) and SAED (e) of Ni3 Mn-LMO. 
The isothermal dehydrogenation curves between the modi- 
ﬁed MgH2 with pristine MgH2 were compared in Fig. 3 (c-f). 
Generally, the dehydrogenation performance of MgH2 + 9wt% 
Ni3 Mn-LMO was superior to that of MgH2 + 9wt% Ni3 Mn- 
LDH at all temperatures, while the pristine MgH2 per- 
formed worse than both. Both MgH2 + 9wt% Ni3 Mn-LDH and 
MgH2 + 9wt% Ni3 Mn-LMO can discharge hydrogen at tem- 
peratures as low as 235 °C, with 3.20wt% and 4.44wt% of 
hydrogen in 60 min, respectively. Raising the temperature to 
250 °C, the dehydrogenation kinetics became much faster. 
Speciﬁcally, as shown in Fig. 3 (f) and its inset, the rate of 
MgH2 + 9wt% Ni3 Mn-LMO for releasing 5wt% H2 is 4.57 
times larger than that of MgH2 + 9wt% Ni3 Mn-LDH. Remark- 
ably, MgH2 + 9wt% Ni3 Mn-LMO was able to emit 6.59wt% 
H2 in just 5 min at 295 °C, while at the same temperature, 
MgH2 + 9wt% Ni3 Mn-LDH required 10 min to release the 
same amount of H2 . 
In order to gain insight into the mechanism of de- 
hydrogenation kinetics, isothermal dehydrogenation curves 
of MgH2 , MgH2 + 9wt% Ni3 Mn-LDH, and MgH2 + 9wt% 
Ni3 Mn-LMO were ﬁtted to the Chou-model [ 37 ] to derive the 
rate-controlling steps of the dehydrogenation reaction. The de- 
hydrogenation process of MgH2 in the Chou-model consists 
mainly of two models, penetration and diffusion, with the 
penetration model being the slower step in the hydrogen re- 
lease process compared to the diffusion model. As shown in 
Fig. 4 (a-b) and Fig. S10(a-b), the penetration model dom- 
inates the rate control step for pristine MgH2 as well as 
for MgH2 + 9wt% Ni3 Mn-LDH, which is in accordance with 
the experimental results. For MgH2 + 9wt% Ni3 Mn-LMO, the 
rate control step of the Chou-model transforms into a dif- 
fusion step ( Fig. 4 (c) and Fig. S10(c)), which also provides 
strong evidence that the catalytic performance with Ni3 Mn- 
LMO is superior to that of Ni3 Mn-LDH. In addition, we 
calculated the dehydrogenation activation energies of MgH2 , 
MgH2 + 9wt% Ni3 Mn-LDH, and MgH2 + 9wt% Ni3 Mn-LMO 
using the Arrhenius equation [ 38 ] to further illustrate the im- 
provement on kinetics. The results are shown in Fig. 4 (d) 
and Fig. S12(a-c). The dehydrogenation activation energy of 
pristine MgH2 was 150.90 ± 2.58 kJ ·mol−1 , which was re- 
duced to 103.68 ± 5.24 kJ ·mol−1 with the addition of 9wt% 
Ni3 Mn-LDH, and the dehydrogenation activation energy was 
further reduced with the addition of 9wt% Ni3 Mn-LMO to 
86.88 ± 6.48 kJ ·mol−1 . The greatly reduced activation en- 
ergy further supports the excellent hydrogen desorption capa- 
bility of MgH2 + 9wt% Ni3 Mn-LMO. In particular, the dehy-

drogenation activation energy is much lower than that of other 
magnesium matrix composites (Table S2), which explains the 
source of its excellent hydrogen release properties. Combining 
the Chou-model and the activation energy, Fig. 4 (e) vividly 
depicts the hydrogen release of MgH2 in different environ- 
ments. It can be summarized that the layered metallic oxide 
is an efﬁcient catalyst that well enhanced the dehydrogenation 
ability of MgH2 . 
2.3. Effect of NiMn-LDH and NiMn-LMO nanosheets on the 
hydrogen absorption reaction of MgH2 
Hydrogen absorption experiments including non-isothermal 
and isothermal hydrogenation were performed on MgH2 , 
MgH2 + 9wt% Ni3 Mn-LDH, and MgH2 + 9wt% Ni3 Mn-LMO 
to evaluate the hydrogen absorption performance. Fig. 5 (a) 
illustrates the non-isothermal hydrogen absorption curves, 
which show the onset of hydrogen absorption of pristine 
MgH2 was 120 °C. With the introducing of 9wt% Ni3 Mn- 
LDH and 9wt% Ni3 Mn-LMO, the onset hydrogen absorp- 
tion temperatures decreased to 50 °C and 28 °C, respec- 
tively. The results of isothermal hydrogen absorption tests 
performed at different temperatures are shown in Fig. 5 (b-e). 
The fully dehydrogenated MgH2 + 9wt% Ni3 Mn-LDH could 
absorb 3.36wt% H2 in 60 min at 100 °C, while MgH2 + 9wt% 
Ni3 Mn-LMO could charge 4.34wt% H2 at identical condition, 
and 3.49wt% H2 could be absorbed in 60 min at a lower 
temperature of 75 °C. The hydrogen absorption rates were 
compared at the same temperature of 150 °C ( Fig. 5 (e)). For 
the same absorption of 5wt% H2 , the rate of MgH2 + 9wt% 
Ni3 Mn-LMO is 4.56 times higher than that of MgH2 + 9wt% 
Ni3 Mn-LDH. Encouragingly, MgH2 + 9wt% Ni3 Mn-LMO can 
charge even as much as 6.1wt% of H2 at 150 °C in only 
10 min. In contrast, undoped MgH2 requires a higher operat- 
ing temperature to achieve the same rehydrogenation perfor- 
mance of the doped samples. 
The rehydrogenation activation energies of MgH2 , 
MgH2 + 9wt% Ni3 Mn-LDH, and MgH2 + 9wt% Ni3 Mn-LMO 
calculated by the Arrhenius equation are shown in Fig. 5 (f) 
and Fig. S12(d-f). The activation energy for rehydrogenation 
of pristine MgH2 was 73.75 ± 0.48 kJ ·mol−1 , which de- 
creased to 54.37 ± 0.51 kJ ·mol−1 and 39.41 ± 0.31 kJ ·mol−1 
after the addition of 9wt% Ni3 Mn-LDH and 9wt% Ni3 Mn- 
LMO, respectively. In order to understand the rate-controlling 
steps of the rehydrogenation reaction, isothermal hydrogen 
absorption curves were ﬁtted with the Chou-model as well. 
As shown in Fig. S11, the hydrogen uptake of pristine MgH2 
is mainly dominated by the penetration equation at lower tem- 
peratures of 210 °C, 230 °C, and 250 °C, and the dominant 
step changes from penetration to diffusion as the temperature 
rises up to 270 °C. This is due to the fact that the hydrogen 
uptake process of MgH2 is more sensitive to temperature. In 
the case of MgH2 + 9wt% Ni3 Mn-LDH, the controlling step is 
dominated by penetration at 100 °C, whereas it changes from 
penetration to diffusion at the low temperature of 150 °C. Re- 
garding MgH2 + 9wt% Ni3 Mn-LMO, the main step controlling 
its rehydrogenation, also at 100 °C, is the diffusion model, 
which is consistent with the results of the rehydrogenation

experiments in Fig. 4 . The above results support strongly the 
conclusion that the hydrogen uptake of MgH2 + 9wt% Ni3 Mn- 
LMO is superior to that of MgH2 + 9wt% Ni3 Mn-LDH. 
2.4. Inﬂuence of Ni3 Mn-LDH and Ni3 Mn-LMO on 
thermodynamics of MgH2 
The thermodynamic properties of Ni3 Mn-LDH and Ni3 Mn- 
LMO modiﬁed MgH2 were further investigated by determin- 
ing the equilibrium hydrogen pressures of MgH2 , MgH2 + 9 
wt% Ni3 Mn-LDH and MgH2 + 9 wt% Ni3 Mn-LMO at dif- 
ferent temperatures as shown in Fig. S13(a-c). The desorp- 
tion plateau pressures of MgH2 were 2.53, 4.66, 9.82, and 
16.78 bar at 325 °C, 350 °C, 375 °C, and 400 °C. The plateau 
pressures of MgH2 + 9wt% Ni3 Mn-LDH were 1.61, 3.06, 5.86 
and 10.54 bar at 300 °C, 325 °C, 350 °C, and 375 °C, respec- 
tively, while the plateau pressures of MgH2 + 9wt% Ni3 Mn- 
LMO had plateau pressures of 1.55, 2.94, 5.50 and 10.24 bar, 
respectively. The corresponding enthalpies of hydrogen de- 
composition ( H) were calculated by the Van’t Hoff equation 
as shown in Fig. S13(d). The value of H for MgH2 was es- 
timated to be 83.08 ± 2.43 kJ/mol. However, even after the 
addition of Ni3 Mn-LDH (78.04 ± 2.17 kJ/mol) and Ni3 Mn- 
LMO (76.84 ±0.91 kJ/mol) the calculated value of H was 
also slightly lower than that of the prepared MgH2 . There- 
fore, like other previously reported catalysts Ni3 Mn-LDH and 
Ni3 Mn-LMO can signiﬁcantly improve the kinetic properties 
of MgH2 , but have little effect on the thermodynamic prop- 
erties of MgH2 . 
2.5. Cycling feature of MgH2 –9wt% Ni3 Mn-LMO 
The cycling characteristics of composites are considered 
to be an important indicator for assessing hydrogen stor- 
age performance and are necessary for practical applica- 
tions. Since MgH2 + 9wt% Ni3 Mn-LMO has better hydrogen 
storage properties than MgH2 + 9wt% Ni3 Mn-LDH or pris- 
tine MgH2 , we carried out up to 20 isothermal hydrogen 
ab/desorption experiments at 295 °C to investigate the cyclic 
stability of MgH2 + 9wt% Ni3 Mn-LMO. After 20 cycles, the 
MgH2 + 9wt% Ni3 Mn-LMO composite was still able to des- 
orb and absorb 6.22wt%, 6.20wt% H2 , which indicate excel- 
lent reversibility and stability of the MgH2 + 9wt% Ni3 Mn- 
LMO composite. The decrease in reversible hydrogen storage 
capacity is due to the fact that nanoscale MgH2 is highly 
susceptible to particle aggregation and growth during hydro- 
gen uptake and release, leading to capacity decay and kinetic 
degradation. In addition, as the number of cycles increases, a 
small portion of the Mg nucleation and growth leads to the 
inability to be hydrogenated, which will directly lead to a 
decrease in the cycling capacity ( Fig. 6 ). 
2.6. Mechanism for the improved hydrogen storage 
properties 
To identify the catalytic mechanism of LMO in compos- 
ites, the microstructural changes of the materials in the pro- 
cess of dehydrogenation and rehydrogenation were investi- 
gated in detail. XRD results demonstrate that reversible trans- 
formations of MgH2 and Mg dominate during hydrogen des- 
orption and adsorption ( Fig. 7 (a, b)). It is noteworthy that 
due to the high activity of LMO, it reacts with MgH2 dur- 
ing ball milling, leading to the appearance of peaks belong- 
ing to metallic nickel. During the hydrogen release process, 
MgH2 further reacts with metal Ni to form Mg2 Ni, which in 
the subsequent rehydrogenation reacts with hydrogen to form 
Mg2 NiH4 . The generation of Mg2 Ni and Mg2 NiH4 increases 
the free energy and reactivity of the system, which provides 
extra energy for the resolution and adsorption of hydrogen. 
In addition, it acts as a low-energy barrier region for hydro- 
gen diffusion, reducing the hydrogen ad/desorption reaction 
energy barriers of MgH2 . In addition, the XRD pattern of the 
rehydrogened state after 20 cycles is shown in Fig. S15 (a), 
the appearance of the Mg peaks conﬁrms the decrease of the 
capacity during the cycling process. 
However, no diffraction peaks were found for compounds 
about Mn, which may be due to the in situ reduction of Mn 
or its low content [ 24 ]. Therefore, the changes of Ni and 
Mn in LMO were further analyzed by XPS measurement. 
It should be noted that during the characterization of XPS,

the percentage of catalyst was increased to 20wt% in or- 
der to ensure the effective identiﬁcation of the Ni and Mn 
states. The non-isothermal hydrogen release curves with the 
addition of 20wt% LMO are comparable to the addition of 
9wt% LMO (Fig. S14), suggesting that the evolution of Ni 
and Mn in the reaction is consistent. Full region XPS spectra 
displayed the signals of Mg 1s, Ni 2p, Mn 2p, O 1s, and 
C 1s in Fig. 7 (c). After ball milling, the peaks of Ni0 2p 
(852.7 and 870.1 eV) [ 39 ] can be clearly detected by XPS 
( Fig. 7 (d)), indicating that metallic Ni was generated during 
the ball milling process, which is in agreement with the re- 
sults of XRD. The peaks of Ni2 + 2p (855.5 and 872.2 eV) 
and Ni3 + 2p (856.86 and 874 eV) [ 40 , 41 ] belong to unreacted 
NiO and NiMn2 O4 . After dehydrogenation, peaks belonging 
to Ni2 + and Ni3 + disappeared due to reduction, with Ni0 2p 
(852.4 and 869.8 eV) belonging to Mg2 Ni observed in Ni 2p 
XPS spectra [ 42 ]. After rehydrogenation, the peaks of Ni0 
2p (852.4 and 869.8 eV) belonging to Mg2 NiH4 still existed 
[ 43 ]. The evolution of Mg2 Ni and Mg2 NiH4 agrees well with 
the XRD results. In contrast, the different valence states of 
Mn in LMO were consistently observed during the whole re- 
action ( Fig. 7 (e)). In the ball-milled state, peaks belonging 
to MnO (640.0 and 650.3 eV), Mn2 O3 (642.2 and 652.5 eV), 
and MnO2 (644.5 and 654.8 eV) can be observed [ 44 , 45 ]. Af-

ter subsequent dehydrogenation and rehydrogenation, partial 
reduction of Mn3 + and Mn4 + leads to an increase in Mn2 + 
content. The XPS of the rehydrogenated state after 20 cy- 
cles is also shown in Fig. S15 (b-d), the same Ni0 2p (852.4 
and 869.8 eV) peaks belonging to Mg2 NiH4 are observed as 
in the rehydrogenated state. While after 20 cycles, a further 
increase in Mn2 + content was observed in the Mn 2p XPS 
spectra due to the reducing effect. Consequently, it could be 
concluded that the multivalent state changes of Ni and Mn 
in LMO could promote the process of H2 desorption and ad- 
sorption of MgH2 . 
Subsequently, the evolution of the microstructure of MgH2 
catalyzed by LMO was investigated using TEM and HRTEM 
( Fig. 8 (A, B) and Fig. S16, S17). The TEM and HRTEM of 
ball-milled MgH2 + 9wt% Ni3 Mn-LMO is displayed in Fig. 
S16, in the same results as the XRD that besides the obser- 
vation of MgH2 , facets belonging to Ni are also observed. 
The microscopic morphology of MgH2 after dehydrogenation 
is shown in Fig. 8 A(a-c). It can be observed that the LMO 
nanosheets introduced into MgH2 are fragmented into ﬁne 
sheets. From the HRTEM images ( Figs. 8 A(d, f) and 8B(e, f)), 
the (102), (100) planes corresponding to Mg and the (002), 
(200) planes of MgH2 can be observed. This indicates that 
the reversible transformation of Mg and MgH2 occurs during 
the H2 desorption and adsorption process, which is in good 
agreement with the XRD results. During the initial dehydro- 
genation process, HRTEM images ( Fig. 8 A(d, f)) illustrate 
the obvious interplanar distance of 0.191 nm and 0.278 nm, 
which belong to the (102) and (100) planes of Mg. It’s worth 
noting that lattice spacings of 0.205 nm could be indexed 
to the (114) planes of Mg2 Ni, in supportive with the XRD 
and XPS results. After the hydrogenation process, new lattice 
spacings of 0.230 nm can be observed ( Fig. 8 B(d, f)), point- 
ing to the (220) planes of Mg2 NiH4 . Furthermore, the dehy- 
drogenated and rehydrogenated HRTEM image show distinct 
lattice spacings of 0.157, 0.215, and 0.196 nm, which can 
be pointed to the (220) face of metallic MnO, the (133) face 
of Mn2 O3 , and the (210) face of MnO2 , respectively, which 
are also in good agreement with the XPS results. The TEM 
pattern of the rehydrogened state after 20 cycles is shown in 
Fig. S17. It can be observed that after 20 cycles, the grain 
size of MgH2 has grown. which is the reason for the decay 
of hydrogen storage after cycling. In addition, the results of 
the EDS mapping ( Fig. 8 (A, B)(g)) revealed that elements 
of Ni, Mn, and O were uniformly dispersed on the surface 
of Mg and MgH2 , which conﬁrms that the LMO has sufﬁ-

cient contact with Mg/MgH2 during the reaction process. The 
in-situ formed Mg2 Ni/Mg2 NiH4 and Mn species of (MnO, 
Mn2 O3 , MnO2 ) collaborate to exhibit a signiﬁcant impact in 
the catalysis procedure to boost the kinetics of the Mg/MgH2 
system. 
Theoretical calculations based on Density Functional The- 
ory (DFT) are utilised to elucidate the catalytic mechanism 
of NiMn-LMO in the hydrogen storage of MgH2 . The afore- 
mentioned NiMn-LMO acts in dual capacities: as a hydrogen 
pump and as an efﬁcient catalyst. The presence of Mg2 Ni fa- 
cilitates a more straightforward two-step hydrogen storage re- 
action, as opposed to a direct reaction with Mg. Concurrently, 
MnOx catalysis expedites these processes, making them more 
stable and efﬁcient. A two-step model is employed to sim- 
ulate both adsorption and desorption reactions ( Fig. 9 (e, f)). 
Lower energy barriers are evident in models with MnOx , con- 
sistent with experimental ﬁndings ( Fig. 9 (e, f)). Inﬂuenced 
by MnOx , the reaction’s intermediary product, Mg2 Ni-H, ex- 
hibits a higher total energy. This typically indicates a less 
stable structure, predisposed to easy bond dissociation, which 
results in a quicker hydrogen transformation from Mg2 NiH4 
to Mg during H2 adsorption, and simpler dehydrogenation in 
the desorption process. A comparative analysis was conducted 
on the state structure of Mg2 Ni with and without MnOx , to 
further understand why MnOx can weaken the bond between 
the catalyst and hydrogen. Density of State (DOS) analysis re- 
veals a signiﬁcant change in state structure induced by MnOx 
(Fig. S19(a)). More speciﬁcally, Mg2 Ni with MnOx has a 
lower d-bond center at −1.581 eV compared to −0.941 eV 
of pure Mg2 Ni (Fig. S18 (b)). According to the d-bond the- 
ory proposed by Norskov [ 46 ], a lower d-bond center forms 
a lower antibonding orbital, which is more easily ﬁlled by 
electrons, thereby reducing the overall bonding strength. The 
alteration in the state structure is attributed to the electron ex- 
change between MnOx and Mg2 Ni, visible in Fig. S19. Table 
S3 provides a detailed charge distribution among each atom. 
In comparison to an isolated situation, MnOx draws 6.395 
electrons from Mg2 Ni, causing the aforementioned state struc-

ture change. In summary, MnOx draws electrons from Mg2 Ni, 
producing a new DOS structure with a lower d-bond center. 
This unique change weakens the bond between hydrogen and 
Mg2 Ni pump. Macroscopically, this results in a more moder- 
ate hydrogen absorption and release temperature, along with 
a faster rate. 
Combined with XRD, XPS, TEM, and DFT analysis, 
the catalytic mechanism is presented in Fig. 10 . The LMO 
nanosheets with large speciﬁc surface area are in close con- 
tact with MgH2 , which creates a favorable environment (a 
large number of activation sites and diffusion channels) for 
the catalysis of solid-state dehydrogenation/hydrogenation re- 
actions. Ni produced by reduction during ball milling reacts 
well with MgH2 during dehydrogenation to produce Mg2 Ni, 
which is converted to Mg2 NiH4 during rehydrogenation. The 
formation of Mg2 Ni/Mg2 NiH4 acts as a “hydrogen pump”
to promote the hydrogen storage process in MgH2 [ 47 , 48 ]. 
Speciﬁcally, the enthalpy of formation of Mg2 Ni/Mg2 NiH4 is 
lower than that of Mg/MgH2 , and thus takes the lead to react 
with hydrogen during hydrogen absorption and desorption. In 
addition, Mg2 Ni/Mg2 NiH4 can provide a large number of low- 
energy barrier H diffusion channels to accelerate the adsorp- 
tion and desorption of hydrogen. Meanwhile, the multivalent 
chemical environment of Mn during hydrogen absorption and 
desorption also greatly contributes to the kinetic properties 
of MgH2 . LMO owns the advantages of high speciﬁc surface 
area and abundant active sites of 2D materials. Besides, the 
in-suit generated Mg2 Ni/Mg2 NiH4 served as nano-hydrogen 
pumps and the multivalent state of Mn accelerated the elec- 
tron transfer during catalysis. Therefore, LMO exerts excellent 
catalytic effect on Mg-based hydrogen storage materials. 
3. Conclusion 
In this work, 2D NiMn-LDH and NiMn-LMO were suc- 
cessfully synthesized. Both Ni3 Mn-LDH and Ni3 Mn-LMO 
signiﬁcantly improved the hydrogen storage properties of 
MgH2 . In particular, MgH2 + Ni3 Mn-LMO has better hydro- 
gen uptake and discharge kinetics. The kinetic analysis of 
the Chou model revealed that the dehydrogenation process of 
the LMO-modiﬁed MgH2 was transformed from penetration- 
controlled step to diffusion-controlled step. MgH2 + 9wt% 
Ni3 Mn-LMO started to release hydrogen at as low as 190 °C 
and was able to release 6.59wt% hydrogen in 5 min at a con- 
stant temperature of 295 °C. Even at as low as 250 °C it was 
able to release 5.02wt% hydrogen in 11 min, and the acti- 
vation energy of dehydrogenation of MgH2 + 9wt% Ni3 Mn- 
LMO was reduced to 86.88 ±6.48 kJ ·mol−1 . After 20 cy- 
cles, MgH2 + 9wt% Ni3 Mn-LMO still had a reversible capac- 
ity of 6.22wt%, exhibiting good cycling performance. Mi- 
crostructural analysis illustrated that the high speciﬁc sur- 
face area of LMO, abundant active sites, reversible conver- 
sion of Mg2 Ni/Mg2 NiH4 , and multivalent chemical environ- 
ment of Mn synergistically promoted the improvement of 
hydrogen storage performance of MgH2 . And DFT calcu- 
lations indicated that Mg2 Ni/Mg2 NiH4 acted as a hydrogen 
pump to reduce the adsorption energy of hydrogen molecules 
on the MgH2 surface and promote the dissociation of ad- 
sorbed hydrogen molecules into hydrogen atoms. In turn, 
the presence of manganese oxides can absorb electrons from 
Mg2 Ni/Mg2 NiH4 , producing a new DOS structure with lower 
d-bonding centers. This unique change further weakens the 
bond between hydrogen and Mg2 Ni/Mg2 NiH4 leading to a 
further decrease in the energy barrier for hydrogen adsorption 
and dissociation. Our research provides a simple and efﬁcient 
strategy to synthesize layered metal oxides with high speciﬁc 
surface area and high catalytic activity and demonstrates an 
effective method to improve the hydrogen storage properties 
of MgH2 .
