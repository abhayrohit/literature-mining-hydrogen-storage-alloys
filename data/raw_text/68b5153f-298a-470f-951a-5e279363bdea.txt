Abstract: Storing hydrogen in solid metal hydrides provides a safe and efficient storage approach.
However, the large volume expansion of metal hydrides during hydrogen absorption imposes
substantial stresses on the wall of a hydrogen storage tank. In this study, volume expansion behavior
of a V-based hydrogen storage alloy, V61Cr24Ti12Ce3, with body-centered-cubic, was investigated
using a self-developed in situ expansion testing device. The lattice expansion of the V61Cr24Ti12Ce3
alloy after full hydrogenation was determined to be 37.85% using X-ray diffraction(XRD). The powder
bed, composed of alloy powder with an average size of 3.35 mm in diameter, displays a large volume
expansion ratio of 131% at the first hydrogen absorption cycle and 40–45% in the following four
cycles. The stable compact bed, made of alloy powders, organic silicone gel, and graphite flakes,
shows significantly smaller volume expansion ratio, which is 97% at the first cycle and 21% at the
second cycle, and stabilizes at 13% in the following cycles. Also, the compact bed shows similar
hydrogen absorption capacity, but faster absorption kinetics compared to the powder bed.

1. Introduction
To achieve the sustainable development of our society, a stable supply of environ-
mentally harmless clean energy is essential. Renewable energies like solar and wind have
great potential, but the time-dependent and geography-dependent variability limits their
application as power resources [1,2]. Hydrogen, as an ideal energy carrier, offers a solution
for energy storage and transportation [3]. Metal hydrides, which can reversibly absorb hy-
drogen in large quantity under mild conditions, have been attracting world-wide attention
as the medium for hydrogen storage.
Metal hydrides are categorized into interstitial (e.g., VH2 and LaNi5H6) and non-
interstitial hydrides (e.g., MgH2). Vanadium (V)-based alloy, with body centered cubic
(BCC) structure, is noteworthy for its high hydrogen storage density and fast hydrogen
sorption kinetics [4,5]. Different V-based alloy systems have been developed, including
V-Ti-Cr, V-Ti-Cr-Fe, and so on, which exhibits reversible capacities of ~2.5 wt.% under
ambient conditions (e.g., 0–80 ◦C at 10 MPa H2) [4]. Furthermore, a big progress has been
made in economical approaches to prepare V-based alloys, for example, from low-cost
ferrovanadium master alloy or directly from oxides [4]. However, it is still a big distance
from the practical application of vanadium-based alloys for hydrogen storage.
The hydrogen absorption process is accompanied by significant volume expansion,
particularly in interstitial hydrides. For instance, the volume of LaNi5 alloy can increase
by about 20% after full hydrogenation [6], and the lattice of vanadium-based alloy can
expand by approximately 40% [7]. Such large volume expansion would lead to the pul-
verization of alloy particles and reduce the heat and mass transfer efficiency within the

tank [8], unavoidably imposing substantial stress on hydrogen storage tanks, potentially
causing deformation or rupture [9,10]. Turning powders into compact after mixing with
additives (such as binder and anti-expansion agent) could alleviate the impact of volume
expansion of the metal hydrides [11–16]. For example, the LaNi5 compact, made from
1 mm LaNi5 powders and resin, shows very stable structure with only a small amount of
powder detached after 100 hydrogen sorption cycles [17]. Tarasov [18] et al. employed
a graphene–nickel composite to enhance the desorption reaction of magnesium hydride.
While the graphene–nickel material facilitated the magnesium hydride desorption reac-
tion, the graphene component was prohibitively expensive for large-scale implementation.
Compacts of Mg90Ni10 powder and Ti-Mn-based powder after mixing with expanded
graphite (ENG) could increase the thermal conductivity of the metal hydride bed and
reduce the stress during the hydrogen sorption process [19]. There are also some studies
on the preparation of membranes with hydrogen selective permeability using polymers
mixed with metal hydrides [20]. However, few investigations focusing on the volume
expanding behaviors of V-based hydrogen storage alloys during hydrogen sorption have
been reported.
In the present study, we designed and constructed a dedicated expansion test appa-
ratus to evaluate the in situ volume expansion of V-based alloy, V61Cr24Ti12Ce3 (at.%),
during the hydrogen absorption process. Organic silicone gel, also known as PDMS, is a
commercially available highly elastic polymer composed primarily of silicone oil and a
curing agent. Its curing process is relatively straightforward, and it has been demonstrated
to be non-toxic to V-Ti-Cr-Fe alloys [21]. So, the compact, composed of V61Cr24Ti12Ce3
powders, organic silica gel (PDMS) [22] and graphite flakes, was designed to reduce the
volume expansion.
2. Results and Discussions
The pressure–composition–temperature (PCT) curves of the V61Cr24Ti12Ce3 alloy
for hydrogen absorption (Figure 1a) and desorption (Figure 1b) were measured at 0 ◦C,
18 ◦C, and 50 ◦C, respectively. The hydrogen desorption plateau pressure (Peq) of the
V61Cr24Ti12Ce3 alloy at 18 ◦C reaches 4.6 bar, which meets with the requirement of entry
pressure for the operation of fuel cell. Based on the desorption PCT curves in Figure 1b, the
V61Cr24Ti12Ce3 alloy achieves a reversible hydrogen storage capacity of 2.51 wt.% at 50 ◦C
within the pressure region of 0.01–10 MPa. The van’t Hoff plots, obtained by plotting Peq
versus 1/T, are shown in Figure 1c. The enthalpy change (∆H) and entropy change (∆S)
are derived and listed in Table 1.

Figure 2a,b show the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the V61Cr24Ti12Ce3 alloy
before and after hydrogenation, respectively. Before hydrogenation, the V61Cr24Ti12Ce3
alloy shows the typical BCC structure, with a = 0.3031 (1) Å and V = 0.02785 Å3, as presented
in Table 2. After hydrogenation, the minor V4H2.88-type BCT phase and the major VH2-type
FCC phase are observed, attributed to subsequent phase transition from BCC to BCT and
from BCT to FCC during the hydrogen absorption process (Figure 2c). The BCT phase
shows the lattice parameters of a = 0.3143 (0) Å and c = 0.3148 (3) Å, and lattice volume
increases up to V = 0.03110 Å3, with a lattice expansion ratio of 11.67% compared to the
BCC phase. The FCC phase shows the lattice parameters of a = 0.4250 (3) Å, and lattice
volume increases up to V = 0.07678 Å3, with an expansion ratio of 23.44% compared to the
BCT phase and an expansion ratio of 37.85% compared to the BCC phase.

Figure 3a,b show the hydrogen absorption plots of the pure powder bed and the
compact bed with a diameter of 10 mm after five cycles. Both beds contain the same
amount of alloy for testing. The first absorption reaction was conducted at 0 ◦C, and the
rest of the absorption reactions were carried out at 20 ◦C. The powder bed shows the
fast absorption kinetics at the first absorption cycle (Figure 3a), which reached saturation
within 10 min with the absorption capacity of 3.5 wt.%. In the following four cycles, the
powder bed could absorb hydrogen at ~2.0 wt.% within 10 min. In contrast, the compact
bed shows slightly slower absorption kinetics at the first absorption cycle, which requires
approximately 20 min to reach the saturation state with a capacity of 3.4 wt.%. In the
subsequent four cycles, the powder bed displays much faster absorption kinetics with a

hydrogen absorption amount of ~2.0 wt.% within 5 min. Furthermore, the compact bed
still maintains its structure after five cycles, as shown in Figure 3c,d.

5 cycles; the images of compact bed: (c) initial state and (d) after 5 cycles.
Figure 4a presents real-time data of position sensor for the V61Cr24Ti12Ce3 alloy
powder bed during the five cycles of hydrogen absorption and desorption, which was
measured using the self-made in situ expansion testing device shown in Figure 7. The time
required for the powder bed to complete the hydrogen sorption reaction is 72, 49, 54, 58,
and 59 min, for the first to fifth cycles, respectively. The powder bed was vibrated after
the completion of each hydrogen absorption and desorption cycle. The volume expansion
ratio in each cycle was calculated by comparing the height after hydrogen absorption of
the current cycle with the height after hydrogen desorption in the initial cycle, as shown in
Figure 4b. The alloy powder shows the highest expansion ratio of 131% at the first hydrogen
absorption cycle, assigned to the phase evolution from BCC to FCC of V61Cr24Ti12Ce3. The
expansion ratio decreases to 45% in the second cycle and stabilizes between 40% and 43%
from the third to the fifth cycle. Figure 4c presents the particle size distribution of alloy
powder after five hydrogen absorption/desorption cycles. The size of the majority of the
powder decreases to below 0.355 mm, much smaller than the initial particle size of 3.35 mm.

bed during the 5 cycles. The particle size (c) of V61Cr24Ti12Ce3 alloy powder after 5 cycles.
Figure 5a presents real-time data from the position sensor for compact bed during the
five cycles. The compact bed was vibrated after the completion of each hydrogen absorption
and desorption cycle. Figure 5b shows the corresponding positional information of the
position sensor and the volume expansion ratio of each cycle. The expansion ratio of the
first hydrogen absorption cycle is calculated to be 97%, a reduction of 34% compared to
the alloy powder bed. The volume expansion ratio of the second circle decreases to 21%
and stabilizes at 13% afterwards. Additionally, the durations required for the compact
bed to complete the hydrogen sorption reaction are 91, 39, 44, 41, and 33 min for the
first to the fifth cycle, respectively, which are significantly shortened compared to the
values for the alloy powder bed in Figure 4a. Hence, the conversion of powder bed to

Inorganics 2024, 12, 318

compact bed accelerates the hydrogen absorption kinetics, probably attributed to improved
effective thermal conductivity. Figure 5c,d show the initial state of the compact bed before
and after five hydrogen sorption cycles, respectively. The shape of the compact bed was
basically maintained.

alloy powder during the 5 cycles. The state of composite hydrogen storage material before hydrogen
absorption (c) and after 5 cycles (d).
For the two beds, the largest volume expansion was observed at the first cycle, which
is attributed to lattice expansion during the phase transition of the V61Cr24Ti12Ce3 alloy
from BCC to FCC structure. Since the second cycle, the volume expansion ratio of the
powder bed almost stabilizes at 40–45%, accompanied with the phase transition from BCT
to FCC. The compact bed shows a much smaller volume expansion ratio of 21% at the
second cycle, which further decreases and stabilizes at 13% after the third cycle. The slight
decrease in volume expansion ratio from the second to the third cycle may be attributed to
continuous pulverization of V61Cr24Ti12Ce3 alloy powder or slow formation process of the
stable silicone elastomers.
Note that after the completion of each cycle, the powder bed and compact bed were vi-
brated. The sensor positions after vibration are listed in Table 3. For the powder bed, sensor
position after vibration decreases continuously from the first to the fifth cycle, implying that
the bed became more compact after vibration probably owing to the pulverization of alloy
powders. Differently, the sensor position of the compact bed changes slightly and keeps
almost constant from the third to the fifth cycle, indicative of the formation of stable bed.

SEM and EDS analyses were conducted on the compact bed after five cycles, as il-
lustrated in Figure 6. SEM and mapping results in Figure 6(a,a1,a2) reveal that graphite
flakes and organosilicon gel are uniformly distributed on the surface of the alloy particles.
Figure 6b–d demonstrate that the organic silica gel (PDMS) effectively binds the pulverized
particles. Graphite has a lubricating effect, which could reduce the friction between parti-
cles [23]. Organic silica gel (PDMS) cured like ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer is highly
elastomeric, which not only secures the graphite flakes tightly to the alloy particles but
also fixes the alloy particles in situ. Accordingly, the utilization of a combination of alloy
particles, organic silica gel (PDMS), and graphite flakes in the form of a compact bed not
only effectively mitigates the volume expansion of the alloy bed but also contributes to the
immobilization of the pulverized alloy powders.

3. Materials and Methods
The V61Cr24Ti12Ce3 alloy was prepared via floating melting with raw materials of V
(purity: 99.9%), Ti (purity: 99.6%), Cr (purity: 99.6%) and Fe (purity: 99.9%). The as-cast
V61Cr24Ti12Ce3 alloy was annealed at 1400 ◦C for 0.5 h under dynamic vacuum. The
as-annealed alloy was crushed to a powder size of ~3.35 mm using a jaw crusher under
nitrogen atmosphere.
The alloy powders were mixed with graphite flake (Macklin Biochemical Technology
Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) and organosilicon gel (Sylgard 184, Dow Corning, Midland, MI,
America) with a mass ratio of 92%: 4%: 4%. The mixture was subjected to a pressing and
molding process, with a pressure of 500 MPa maintained for a duration of one minute. Two
types of compact bed, one with a diameter of 10 mm and another with an inner diameter of
10 mm and an outer diameter of 45 mm, were prepared. Prior to the commencement of
cycling tests, the compact bed was stored at room temperature for ≥24 h in an Ar-circulated
glove box to allow the silicone gel to fully cure and form an elastomer.
Alloy powders were loaded in a stainless-steel reactor for pressure–composition–
temperature (PCT) measurement. To activate the alloy for hydrogen sorption, the alloy
powders were evacuated for 1 h at room temperature, followed by the introduction of
hydrogen at 7.5 MPa. The alloy powders could fast react with hydrogen at room tempera-
ture. The hydrogen absorption PCT curves were measured at 0, 18, and 50 ◦C. To measure
the hydrogen desorption PCT curves, the alloy powders were fully hydrogenated at 0 ◦C
under 7.5 MPa H2, and subsequently, the temperature of the reactor was set to the targeting
temperatures of 0, 18, and 50 ◦C, respectively. The measurement of hydrogen desorption
PCT measurement started after the hydrogen pressure became stable. The X-ray diffraction
(XRD) measurements were conducted using Cu Kα radiation (Rigaku, Tokyo, Japan), and
the XRD data were analyzed using FullProf 2023 [24]. Microstructures was observed via
scanning electron microscope (SEM, JSM-7800F, JEOL Ltd., Tokyo, Japan).
To investigate the actual expansion of the V61Cr24Ti12Ce3 alloy during the hydrogen
absorption process, an in situ expansion testing device was designed and a corresponding
testing platform was established, as depicted in Figure 7. The testing device contains the
expansion test reactor, two water baths, and a flow and pressure controller. A steel plate
together with a position sensor was placed on top of the sample. The sensor could measure
the position of the steel plate, which reflects the volume change in the tested sample. Two
water baths were maintained to offer cold and hot water for the hydrogen absorption and
desorption processes, respectively. The hydrogen flows and pressures during the testing
process could be controlled and monitored from the test platform which was equipped
with flow meters and pressure sensors. Before testing, the alloy powder bed or compact

Inorganics 2024, 12, 318

bed was activated under vacuum for 2 h, followed by the introduction of 7.5 MPa H2 at
5 ◦C. The hydrogen desorption was carried out under a dynamic vacuum at 80 ◦C. The
hydrogen absorption and desorption cycle were repeated 5 times.

4. Conclusions
We have demonstrated the volume expansion behavior of the V61Cr24Ti12Ce3 al-
loy measured using the self-made volume expansion test device. Firstly, the maximum
reversible capacity of V61Cr24Ti12Ce3 alloy is 2.51 wt.%, and the lattice expansion of
V61Cr24Ti12Ce3 alloy in the saturated state of hydrogen absorption is found to be 37.85%
and is analyzed via XRD test. The powder bed of the V61Cr24Ti12Ce3 alloy shows a large
volume expansion ratio of 131% at the first hydrogen absorption cycle and 40~45% in
the following four cycles. The compact bed, made of alloy powders, organic silicone gel
(PDMS), and graphite flakes, shows a significantly smaller volume expansion ratio, which
is 97% at the first cycle and 21% at the second cycle, and stabilizes at 13% in the following
cycles. The highly elastic organic silicone gel (PDMS) serves to retain the graphite flakes on
the alloy particles. Furthermore, the lubrication of the graphite flakes serves to reduce the
interaction force between the powder particles. So, the addition of organic silicone gel and
graphite flakes contributes to the formation of a stable bed of V61Cr24Ti12Ce3 alloy, which
does not reduce the hydrogen absorption capacity but improves the hydrogen absorption
kinetics after the second cycle.
