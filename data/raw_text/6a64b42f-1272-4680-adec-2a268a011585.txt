The interaction between nanomaterial systems and hydrogen has recently emerged as a compelling study
model, oﬀering valuable insights for designing materials with applications in nanotechnology, catalysis, and
energy storage. Among these, transition metal-doped gold clusters exhibits intriguing stability and
electronic properties, making them promising candidates for hydrogen related processes. In this study,
we employ density functional theory (DFT) to investigate the interaction between H2 molecules and
small-sized gold clusters doped with yttrium. Our ﬁnding reveals that most of the bare cluster structures
remain intact during the H2 adsorption, regardless of whether the process occurs molecularly or
dissociatively. A comprehensive analysis indicates that the preferred adsorption conﬁguration is governed
by multiple factors, including adsorption site (surface vs. encapsulated), relative electronegativity, and the
atomic coordination number. The calculations demonstrate that dissociative adsorption of H2 on Au6Y
and Au11Y clusters is both thermodynamically and kinetically favorable. However, for AunY (n = 1, 4–5, 8,
10) dissociative adsorption is hindered by a signiﬁcant energy barrier before reaching the ﬁnal state,
while for species with n = 2, 3, 7, and 9 molecular adsorption is more favorable due to intrinsic energy
preferences. This study provides fundamental insights into the adsorption sites and detailed analysis of
adsorption kinetics on AunY clusters, laying the groundwork for further theoretical an ed experimental
investigations into the hydrogenation process in nanostructured materials.

Introduction
Nowadays, hydrogen has been envisioned as a key energy carrier
for sustainable development of the future economy, meeting
essential environmental and energy requirements.1–3 Compared
to traditional fuels like gasoline (44 MJ kg−1) and diesel (45.6 MJ
kg−1),4,5 hydrogen oﬀers the highest energy density per unit
mass (∼120 MJ kg−1) and conversion eﬃciency and can be
produced through water-splitting reactions without CO2 emis-
sions. Moreover, it can be conveniently stored in various forms,
including gaseous, liquid, or metal hydrides.6–8 However, the
practical implementation of hydrogen energy storage aer
generation and during transport faces signicant challenges,
primarily due to its kinetic stability under ambient conditions
and the low energy density per unit volume of solid storage
materials.
To address this bottleneck, various strategies have been
explored.9–12 Among them, metal hydride materials have
garnered special attention as model solid-state hydrogen
storage systems, oﬀering a more compact and secure alterna-
tive. They provide the possibility of preventing critical operating
conditions like high pressures and elevated temperatures,
which are typical of conventional compressed gas and liqueed
hydrogen storage.13 To enhance the practical prospect of metal
hydride, a deeper understanding of the interaction between
hydrogen and potential surface at the molecule level is essen-
tial. Therefore, nanoclusters consisting of a few atoms have
emerged as promising candidates for providing fundamental
insights into potentially reactive sites, given signicant varia-
tion in physical and chemical properties with size and
composition.
Among various metal nanoclusters, gold nanoclusters (Aun)
are considered particularly advantageous due to their superior
stability, abundance, and cost-eﬀectiveness, even surpassing
palladium and platinum in many aspects. While gold is chem-
ically inert in its bulk form, it exhibits remarkable catalytic
activity at the nano scale. For example, gold nanoclusters have
shown promising performance in catalytic processes such as
water-splitting reaction14 and CO oxidation.15 Interestingly, this

investigated
the
Au12Ag32/TiO2, system, which features a gold icosahedral core
encapsulated by a silver dodecahedral shell. Their nding
revealed a substantial enhancement in solar H2 production
eﬃciency, approximately 6.2 and 37.8 times higher than those
of Ag44/TiO2 and bare TiO2, respectively. Furthermore, key
factors inuencing the reactivity and catalytic potential of gold
nanoclusters include cluster size, atomic composition, and
charge state.17–19 By tailoring these parameters, such as through
doping or precise control of cluster size, researchers can design
tunable materials optimized for specic catalytic processes. For
instance, both experimental and theoretical studies have
explored O2 activation on small-sized anionic Aun−clusters.20 S.
Pal and D. Manzoor have compared the catalytic eﬃciency of
Au8, Pd8, Au8−n Pdn (n = 1–7), Au7Si,21,22 Au18 and endohedral
Au18M (M = Na, K, Mg, Ca, Al, Ga) cages,23 and Al-, Hf-, and Ge-
doped Au20 cages.24 Similarly, Zeng and co-workers25 using DFT

sized gold nanoclusters supported on TiO2. They observed

decreasing as the cluster size increased within the range of 16–
35 atoms.15 Recent studies have also highlighted the emerging
role of hydrogen atoms as dopants in gold nanoclusters.26
Beyond their electronegativity, hydrogen atoms can induce
chemisorption and activation on previously inert or closed-shell
gold clusters,27 modulated by cluster shape,28,29 and charge
state.30 This, in turn, enhances the adsorption and activation of
O2 and CO molecules, opening new directions for designing
advanced gold-based catalysts.
Research eﬀorts have expanded beyond the studies of O2
adsorption and CO oxidation to include investigations of metal
nanoclusters and their alloys in order to deepen our under-
standing of the kinetics and dynamics of hydrogenation reac-
tions. Numerous density functional theory (DFT)31–34 studies
have investigated the adsorption and dissociation of hydrogen
on metal nanoclusters. The H2 absorption process has been
found to strongly depend on the physical and chemical prop-
erties, structural, size, and composition of nanoclusters, as
demonstrated in 3d transition metal (Sc–Zn)-doped Cu clus-
ters35 and Au24M, Au36M (M = Pt and Pd).36 Theoretical studies
have demonstrated that the incorporation of a Pt dopant can
signicantly alter the electronic structure of gold nanoclusters
Aun+1 (n = 1–12), thereby enhancing their reactivity toward H2
molecules.37 Li and coworkers investigated the eﬀect of adsor-
bed hydrogen atoms on the geometric and electronic structures
of alkali-doped gold nanoclusters, providing insights into
hydrogen-cluster interaction.38 Additionally, the adsorption and
dissociation behavior of TiMgn (n = 1–12) clusters has been
examined DFT, revealing key factors that govern their hydrogen
activity.39
Furthermore,

have
provided
insights
into
the
competition between molecular and dissociative hydrogen
chemisorption, which is highly dependent on the size of
cationic aluminum-doped Rh clusters.40,41 Recently, Lan et al.
conducted comparative studies on the inuence of 3d transition
metal atoms on hydrogen adsorption and dissociation by
examining size-dependent AgnCr (n = 2–12) clusters and
composition-dependent Au9M2+ (M = Sc–Ni) clusters.42,43 Their
research has revealed that Ag3Cr, Ag6Cr, and Au9Ti2+, clusters
exhibit the ability to adsorb and dissociate H2, leading to the
formation of metal hydrides even at room temperature.
Additionally, 4d transition metal atoms have shown signi-
cant
potential
for
hydrogen
storage,
attributed
to
their
enhanced stability, fully lled electron congurations across
multiple energy levels, diverse oxidation states, and distinct
chemical properties compared to their 3d counterparts.44,45
Moreover, the lower electronegativity of 4d transition metals
relative to 3d elements inuences their interaction with
hydrogen, raising several intriguing questions, such as how
charge transfer occurs in clusters and the nature of interactions
between dopant clusters and hydrogen molecules. To address
these questions, the eﬀects of boron and 4d transition metal (Y–
Mo) on hydrogen adsorption and storage properties have been
systematically investigated.45–47 Notably, the impact of charge
transfer, electronegativity, and the atomic radius of the dopant
elements on the catalytic mechanism and hydrogen storage
capacity of MgH2 clusters has been claried.48,49 C.S. Sergio et al.

Barab´as
et

combining gas-phase reaction investigations and DFT compu-
tations, has demonstrated that the catalytic activity of gold
cation clusters (Aun+) and yttrium-doped gold (Aun−1Y+, n = 4–
20) clusters can be eﬀectively tuned by cluster size, charge state,
and dopant introduction.51 While initial studies have explored
the inuence of 4d transition metals on cluster stability and
reactivity, a systematic investigation of the hydrogen storage
mechanism in noble metal clusters doped with 4d transition
metals remains lacking. A deeper understanding of the kinetics
and dynamics of hydrogenation reactions in precious metal
species and their alloys could pave the way for new research
directions in hydrogen storage materials.52,53
Driven by the pursuit of nanocluster materials for eﬃcient
hydrogen storage, this study aims to theoretically explore the
critical role of yttrium doping in H2 adsorption and dissociation
on small gold clusters. Using DFT calculations,54 we systemati-
cally analyze the geometrical, relative stability, bonding char-
acteristics, electronic properties, and adsorption energies of
AunY (n = 1–12) clusters. The insights gained from this study
provide a deeper understanding of the inuence of 4d transi-

12) clusters in their ground state, along with their molecularly
and dissociatively adsorbed variants AunY–H2 and AunY–2H. To
generate
initial
cluster
structures,
two
complementary
approaches were employed: (1) a stochastic algorithm was used
to explore a broad range of feasible AunY (n = 1–12) congura-
tions;57 (2) manual structure construction, in which a Y atom
systematically replaced an Au atom at all possible positions
within the cluster. Subsequently, hydrogen adsorption cong-
urations were investigated based on the lowest-energy AunY (n =
1–12) structures, where a single H2 molecule or two dissociated
H atoms were attached at various adsorption sites.
Computationally, predicted structures were rst optimized
by the TPSSTPSS functionals in combination with the cc-pVDZ-
pp basis set for Au and Y atoms, and LanL2DZ for H atoms. For
each cluster size, various structural and spin congurations
were explored and subjected to the convergence criteria.
Nevertheless, only species with relative energies less than 2.0 eV
were selected for single-point energy recalculations at the same
functional level but with an enhanced basis set, specically cc-
pVTZ-pp for Au and Y atoms and LanL2DZ for H atoms. This
approach represents a balanced trade-oﬀbetween computa-
tional accuracy and eﬃciency and has been shown to be reliable
for 4d transition metal-doped noble metal systems.58 To validate
the accuracy and reliability of our computational methodology,
we compared binding energies (BE, eV) of Au2, AuY, AuH, and
YH dimers across diﬀerent functionals, including TPSSTPSS,
BP86, BPW91, BLYP, and PBEPBE. Tables 1 and S1† summarize
the results and benchmarks them against available experi-
mental data, conrming that the TPSSTPSS/cc-pVTZ-pp (for Au
and Y) and LanL2DZ (for H) combination yields the closest
agreement with experimental values. The self-consistent eld
(SCF)59

threshold of 2.0 × 10−5 Hartree per Å for gradients and 5.0 ×
10−3 Å for displacements. The stability of the lowest-energy
structures was further conrmed by calculating harmonic
vibrational frequencies, ensuring they correspond to true
minima on the potential energy surface. To reinforce the
robustness of the ground-state optimization, multiple spin
multiplicities were examined for each structure. The electronic
congurations of all lowest-energy structures were analyzed
using the natural bond orbital (NBO) method.60 To explore the
reaction mechanisms, transition-state (TS) geometries were
identied using the quadratic synchronous transit (QST)
method,61,62 with relaxed potential energy surface (PES) scans
along appropriate internal coordinates. To further verify the
transition states, intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) calcula-
tions were performed, ensuring a continuous and valid
connection between reactants and products.
3.
Optimized geometrical structures
We rst optimized the lowest-energy structures of bare AunY
clusters and then examined both molecular and dissociative
adsorption of hydrogen, leading to the formation of AunY–H2
and AunY–2H clusters, respectively. To ensure the stability of the
obtained geometries, we conducted frequency calculations,
conrming the absence of imaginary frequencies in all opti-
mized structures. While multiple geometrical and spin isomers
exist for each stoichiometry, only the lowest-energy structures of
AunY, AunY–H2, and AunY–2H clusters were selected for further
discussion of hydrogen adsorption behavior, as shown in Fig. 1.
Other low-lying isomers for AunY–H2 and AunY–2H clusters are
provided in the ESI.† 46
Our results indicate that the stable spin congurations of
AunY (n = 1–12) clusters follow an alternating pattern with
a singlet spin state for odd n and a doublet for even n. The lowest-
energy AunY structures tend to adopt a cage-like form as the
cluster size increases, where the Y atom prefers a highly coordi-
nated position. Interestingly, the structural framework of AunY (n
= 1–12) clusters undergoes signicant reconstruction upon
yttrium doping, deviating from the planar conguration of pure
Aun clusters (n # 11).64 Unlike pure gold clusters, where the rst
3D structure appears at n = 12, the introduction of a Y atom
stabilizes 3D geometries at much smaller sizes, starting from n =
4, where four Au atoms coordinate around the Y dopant. The
lowest-lying isomers of AunY (n = 5–8) retain a 2D morphology,
whereas larger clusters (n = 9–12) exhibit 3D structural prefer-
ences. These ndings align well with theoretical predictions and
far-infrared spectral studies of yttrium-doped gold clusters.65
Our calculations suggest that hydrogen adsorption does not
signicantly alter the geometric structure of bare AunY clusters,
except for Au5Y, where H2 preferentially attaches to energeti-
cally unstable bridge sites (Au–Y and Au–Au). Similar behavior
has been observed in transition metal-doped clusters.41–43,66 For
AunY (n = 1–5, 7, 9, and 12), the hydrogen molecule favors direct
attachment to the Y dopant, attributed to diﬀerences in elec-
tronegativity c between Y (1.22), H (2.2), and Au (2.54). Funda-
mentally, hydrogen bonding arises from electrostatic attraction,
facilitated by charge transfer between atoms with signicant
electronegativity diﬀerences. Consequently, bonds between the
low-electronegativity Y atom and high-electronegativity H atom
are more favorable, in agreement with previous reports, where
surface impurities are among the most favored adsorption sites

coordination numbers correspond to higher surface activity,
facilitating stronger H2 adsorption.68 Consequently, atomic
clusters with low-coordination sites exhibit enhanced hydrogen
interaction capability. For example, experimental and theoret-
ical studies on singly rhodium-doped cationic aluminum clus-
ters (AlnRh+) using time-of-ight mass spectrometry and
infrared multiple photon dissociation, in combination with
DFT calculations, have demonstrated that hydrogen preferen-
tially binds to the Al atom rather than the Rh impurity in cluster
sizes where Rh is coordination-saturated or encapsulated.41
This principle helps explain the behavior observed in Au6Y–H2,
Au8Y–H2, Au10Y–H2, and Au11Y–H2 clusters, where a competi-
tion between electronegativity and coordination occurs as H2
preferentially attaches to a low-coordination Au vertex (NAu = 2
or 3) instead of the highly coordinated Y impurity (NY = 6, 8, or
9). A similar hydrogen adsorption trend has been reported for
the clusters AlnCr, AgnCr, Au9M2+, AlnRh2+, and MgnCo, further
reinforcing the critical role of coordination number in deter-
mining the preferred hydrogen adsorption site.41–43,66,69
Upon molecular adsorption, the hydrogen molecule may
dissociate, triggering a structural transformation of the bare
clusters.70 However, the ground-state geometry of AunY clusters
generally remains intact upon hydrogen adsorption, with only
minor distortions observed in Au2Y–2H, Au5Y–2H, and Au8Y–
2H. As illustrated in Fig. 1, following H2 dissociation one Au
atom shis closer to another Au atom in Au2Y–2H, while in
Au5Y–2H and Au8Y–2H, a single Au atom is slightly displaced
from two-membered and three-membered Au chains, respec-
tively. Notably, both cluster size and the position of the Y
dopant signicantly inuence H2 dissociation and adsorption
behavior, which can be categorized into two distinct trends. For
small clusters (n = 2–4), individual hydrogen atoms preferen-
tially bind to the surface Y atom, typically at the Au–Y bridge
site. As the cluster size increases (n = 5–12), the Y atom becomes
progressively encapsulated by surrounding Au atoms, leading to
H atoms favoring Au–Au bridge adsorption rather than direct
interaction with Y. This trend is in good agreement with
previous investigations.43 In the case of AuY–2H, both H atoms
preferentially adsorb on top of the Y surface site, highlighting
the role of dopant coordination and atomic arrangement in
governing hydrogen interaction dynamics.
4.
Relative stability
The relative stability of a clusters is a key parameter that
provides insight into its bonding or dissociation energy, which
are critical in determining reactivity and stability in chemical
reactions. This stability is typically assessed through average
binding energies (BE, in eV) calculations. The BE is dened as
the mean energy diﬀerence between the sum of the total ener-
gies of all isolated constituent atoms and the total energy of the
cluster. The calculation follows the equations below:

atoms, respectively.

Here, E represents the total energy of the clusters or individual
atoms. The binding energy (BE) values of AunY (n = 1–12)
clusters range from 1.59 to 2.58 eV, as shown in Fig. 2 and Table
2. A notable increase in BE is observed for bare AunY clusters in
the small-size range (n = 1–3), rising sharply from 1.59 eV to
a peak of 2.55 eV. This trend persists in the presence of
molecular hydrogen adsorption, although the increase in BE
(from 1.96 eV to 2.48 eV) remains less pronounced compared to
bare clusters of the same size. In contrast, for dissociative
adsorption (AunY–2H), BE values gradually decrease from
2.38 eV to 2.08 eV. In contrast, the BE for dissociative adsorption
AunY–2H exhibit a rough decrease from 2.38 to 2.08 eV. More
remarkably, for larger clusters (n = 4–12), the BE values remain
relatively stable, suggesting that these clusters exhibit greater
stability aer hydrogen release compared to smaller clusters (n
= 1–3). Furthermore, the higher BE values of AunY–2H clusters
(for n = 4–6, 8, 10 and 11) compared to their molecularly
adsorbed AunY–H counterparts indicate that H2 dissociation
following molecular adsorption is more favorable at these sizes.
This nding aligns well with the high intrinsic stability of bare
Au6Y clusters.65 In contrast, for clusters with n = 1–3, 7, and 12,
dissociative adsorption is energetically unfavorable, indicating
that H2 is more likely to remain in molecular form on these
clusters.
5.
Hydrogen adsorption process
The accumulation of small molecules on a surface is known as
adsorption, which can be classied as either physisorption or
chemisorption, depending on the nature of the interaction
between the adsorbate and the surface. Physisorption is gov-
erned by weak van der Waals forces, whereas chemisorption
involves the formation of chemical bonds. The adsorption
process is inuenced by several key factors, including the host
cluster, the type of adsorption, and the energy barrier between
the adsorbate and the surface. A comprehensive understanding
of hydrogen adsorption on AunY (n = 2–12) clusters can be
obtained through detailed analysis of bonding characteristics,
particularly examining the interaction of a hydrogen molecule
or two dissociated hydrogen atoms within a specic chemical
equilibrium. To gain fundamental insights into the adsorption
processes of H2 on AunY clusters, we calculate the adsorption
energy and H–H bond length for both molecular and dissocia-
tive adsorption congurations using the following equations:
Eads(AunY−H2) = E(AunY) + E(H2) −E(AunY−H2)

AunY–2H, respectively. The results are summarized in Table 2. A
preliminary analysis reveals that, compared to the bond length
of isolated H2 (0.75 Å),63 the H–H bond length (dH−H) in AunY–
H2 for n = 1–2, 4–6, 9, and 12 is signicantly elongated, ranging
from 0.76 to 0.85 Å. This increase in bond length indicates that
H2 undergoes activation upon adsorption on these AunY
surfaces. In contrast, the distance between hydrogen atoms in
AunY–2H clusters varies from 2.40 Å to 5.54 Å, conrming
complete H2 dissociation on the cluster surface.
The adsorption energies (Eads) were calculated as the energy
diﬀerence between the total energy of the reactants (AunY + H2)
and the products (AunY–H2 or AunY–2H), as expressed in eqn (4)
and (5). In essence, Eads represents the minimum energy
required to desorb hydrogen from the clusters surface, as listed
in Table 2. Comparing the adsorption energy of molecular and
dissociative
adsorption
congurations,
we
nd
that
all
computed Eads values for the molecular adsorption (AunY–H2)
are positive, ranging from 0.05 to 0.29 eV, indicating that the
formation of AunY–H2 is thermodynamically favorable. For
dissociative adsorption (AunY–2H), Eads values range from
−0.39 to 1.81 eV. Notably, the Eads values for Au2Y–2H, Au3Y–
2H, Au7Y–2H, Au9Y–2H, and Au12Y–2H clusters are negative or
zero (Au7Y–2H), suggesting that dissociative adsorption on

these clusters is endothermic and unlikely to occur spontane-
ously. This phenomenon can be attributed to the decrease in
average binding energy for these clusters compared to their bare
counterparts (Au2Y, Au3Y, Au7Y, Au9Y, and Au12Y). In contrast,
H2 dissociation on AunY–2H (n = 1, 4–6, 8, 10 and 11) clusters is
exothermic and thermodynamically favorable, as evidenced by
the higher computed Eads values for dissociative adsorption
AunY–2H compared to molecular adsorption AunY–H2. It is
worth mentioning that molecular adsorption is more likely to
occur for AunY with n = 2, 3, 7, 9, and 12. On the other hand,
when H2 approaches the surface of AunY (n = 1, 4–6, 8, 10, and
11), it rst undergoes molecular adsorption. Subsequently, the
hydrogen molecule may either desorb from the cluster surface
or eventually undergo dissociation, forming strong atomic
bonds with the cluster. The detachment of adsorbed H2 mole-
cules may dominate in certain cases, as it is inuenced not only
by adsorption energy but also by the activation barrier of the
transition state and multiple intermediate states before reach-
ing a stable dissociative conguration. A more detailed
discussion on this topic will be provided in the following
sections.
To better understand the binding nature of adsorbed
hydrogen molecules on AunY (n = 1–12) clusters, we analyzed
the densities of electronic states (DOS) for both molecular and
dissociative adsorption congurations. The DOS results for
several thermodynamically preferred congurations are illus-
trated in Fig. 3, while data for other species are provided in the
ESI.† 46 For each DOS graph in Fig. 3, both partial and total DOS
are depicted. Solid lines represent spin-up (a) states, whereas
dashed lines correspond to spin-down (b) states. As shown in
Fig. 3, for species where physisorption is energetically feasible
(AunY–H2 with n = 3, 7), most of electronic states associated
with adsorbed hydrogen (red line) appear on the low-energy side
(below −13.0 eV), indicating a weak interaction between
hydrogen and the cluster surface. These states are clearly
separated from the electronic states of the cluster, which extend
beyond −8.5 eV for n = 3 and −10.5 eV for n = 7, respectively.
This indicates that the chemical bonding contribution between
hydrogen and these clusters is relatively weak or potentially
negligible. This observation aligns well with previous studies on
molecular hydrogen adsorption in transition metal-doped Agn
(n = 2–12), Au10
2+ or even [Mo13S13]2−clusters, where van der
Waals forces and/or electrostatic interactions between charge-
polarized hydrogen molecules and cluster surfaces were iden-
tied as the dominant bonding mechanisms.42,43,67
The DOS for dissociative congurations of AunY–2H (n = 4, 6,
8, 11) in Fig. 3, along with additional results for n = 1, 5, and 10
provided in the ESI,† 46 exhibit a distinctly diﬀerent behavior
compared
to
their
molecular
adsorption
counterparts.
Remarkably, an analysis of the DOS spectra reveals an
intriguing observation: the expected low-energy contribution of
s-H2 states, typically associated with molecular adsorption,
disappears entirely in the dissociative congurations. Instead,
the electronic states of hydrogen extend signicantly toward
higher energies, generally exceeding −10.5 eV, with the excep-
tion of n = 1 and 4, where they remain above −8.5 eV. This shi
is attributed to the strong hybridization of valence s-electrons
from hydrogen atoms with those of the cluster, leading to the
formation of stable chemical bonds within these systems.
Additionally, in most cases, the highest occupied molecular
orbital (HOMO) states are predominantly contributed by s-Au
orbitals, further reinforcing the role of gold in hydrogen
dissociation mechanisms. It is important to note that bonding
interactions
are
oen
accompanied
by
electron
transfer
processes.
Therefore,
these
ndings
support
the
earlier
conclusion that hydrogen adsorption preferentially occurs at Au
surface sites.
To gain deeper insight into the dissociative hydrogen
adsorption mechanism in AunY–2H (n = 1, 4–6, 8, 10 and 11)
clusters, we computed possible reaction pathways linking the
reactants to their nal dissociated states for single H2 adsorp-
tion and dissociation. Fig. 4 presents the hydrogen dissociation
pathways for Au4Y, Au6Y, Au8Y, and Au11Y clusters, while
additional data for AuY, Au5Y, and Au10Y are provided in the
ESI.† 46 The activation energy for hydrogen dissociation was
determined by incorporating zero-point energy corrections and
electronic energy values of the reactants and transition states
(TS). Specically, the activation barrier is quantied as the total
energy diﬀerence between the reactants and the TS, oﬀering
insights into the feasibility of hydrogen dissociation on AunY
clusters.
As shown in Fig. 4, the interaction of H2 with Au4Y clusters
follows a stepwise dissociative adsorption mechanism. Initially,
molecular hydrogen preferentially binds to the transition metal
atom Y with an adsorption energy of −0.16 eV. However, to
activate the adsorbed H2, the Au4Y clusters must overcome two
activation barriers (TS1 and TS2) associated with the dissocia-
tion process. The rst activation barrier is 0.78 eV (+0.62 eV
relative to the reactants at −0.16 eV), while the second barrier is
0.73 eV (+0.60 eV relative to the intermediate state I1 at −0.13
eV). Before reaching the nal dissociated product (Au4Y–2H),
the system passes through another intermediate state (I2) at
0.44 eV. The nal state, where the H2 molecule is fully dissoci-
ated, has an energy of −0.27 eV, which is 0.11 eV lower than the
reactant state (−0.16 eV), indicating a thermodynamically
favorable process. A similar dissociative adsorption mechanism
is observed for AunY clusters with n = 1, 5, 6, 8, 10 and 11). As
detailed in the ESI,† the Au5Y cluster follows a comparable
pathway. The activation barrier for H2 dissociation (TS1) is
0.75 eV (+0.70 eV relative to the reactant state), followed by
a signicant energy decrease through the intermediate state I1
(−0.04 eV). Ultimately, the system reaches a fully dissociated
state, forming Au5Y–2H with an energy of −0.52 eV, which is
0.47 eV lower than both the reactants and the H2 adsorption
state (−0.05 eV).
Similarly, for Au6Y cluster, H2 activation requires over-
coming an energy barrier of 0.68 eV for the rst transition state
(TS1, +0.55 eV relative to the reactant state). The system then
proceeds through an intermediate state (I1) with a slight energy
drop of 0.21 eV before reaching the nal dissociated state,
which is 0.39 eV lower than the initial molecular adsorption
state (−0.13 eV). A similar dissociative adsorption pattern is
observed for AuY, Au8Y and Au10Y clusters. The activation
barriers for the rst transition state are 0.48 eV, 0.74 eV and

0.80 eV for the transition state TS1 (0.36 eV, 0.62 eV and 0.66 eV
relative to the reactant state), respectively. Before reaching their
nal stable states, Au8Y and Au10Y pass through intermediate
states with energy drops of +0.56 eV and −0.28 eV, respectively.
In contrast, the AuY cluster reaches its nal state at −1.81 eV
without any intermediate states. Interestingly, the Au11Y cluster
exhibits the lowest activation energy for H2 dissociation among
the studied clusters, with a barrier of 0.63 eV for TS1 (+0.50 eV).
The system transitions through an intermediate state (I1, +0.46
eV) before fully dissociating into the most stable state, Au11Y–
2H, at −0.40 eV (0.27 eV lower than the reactants and the H2
adsorption state, −0.13 eV). Comparing the activation barriers
for H2 dissociation across Au5Y (0.75 eV), Au6Y (0.68 eV), Au8Y
(0.74 eV), Au10Y (0.80 eV), and Au11Y (0.63 eV), it is evident that
the Au10Y cluster exhibits the highest energy barrier at 0.8 eV,
suggesting a more challenging dissociative adsorption process
compared to other clusters.
Although the nal products of H2 dissociation on the Au4Y,
Au5Y, Au8Y, and Au10Y clusters exhibit relatively low energies of
−0.27 eV, −0.52 eV, −0.53 eV, and −0.56 eV, respectively, the
activation energy barriers for H2 dissociation remain relatively
high at 0.78 eV, 0.75 eV, 0.74 eV, and 0.80 eV. This suggests that
while H2 adsorption is energetically favorable for these clusters,
dissociative adsorption is unlikely to occur without external
stimuli, particularly for the Au4Y and Au10Y clusters. For the
AuY cluster, the activation barrier for adsorption-dissociation is
relatively low at 0.48 eV, and the nal product has a signicantly
low energy of −1.81 eV. However, as previously mentioned, this
cluster is known to be unstable, limiting its potential for real-
world catalytic applications. In contrast, the Au6Y and Au11Y
clusters exhibit the lowest activation energy barriers of 0.68 eV
and 0.63 eV, respectively. This indicates that Au6Y and Au11Y
could serve as promising superatoms for hydrogen storage
applications.

Conclusion
In summary, we have systematically investigated the interaction
of H2 with small-sized AunY clusters (n = 1–12) using DFT
calculations. Our ndings highlight the crucial role of transi-
tion metal dopants in stabilizing cluster geometries and
enhancing reactivity toward hydrogen adsorption and dissoci-
ation. We identied that the geometric structure, relative elec-
tronegativity of the dopant atom, and atomic coordination
number (N) are key factors governing the preferred adsorption
congurations. The Y atom exhibits a strong preference for
high-coordination sites, favoring surface positions in smaller
clusters (n = 1–5) before becoming gradually encapsulated by
Au atoms in larger clusters (n = 6–12). Due to its relatively lower
electronegativity (cY = 1.22) compared to gold (cAu = 2.54), H2
adsorption initially favors direct interaction with Y. However, as
cluster size increases (n = 7–12) and the Y dopant attains higher
coordination numbers, hydrogen adsorption shis toward Au
surface sites or Au–Au bridge positions. Notably, our results also
indicate that molecular hydrogen adsorption does not signi-
cantly alter the structure of bare AunY clusters (except for Au5Y).
The adsorption of two dissociated hydrogen atoms preferen-
tially occurs at Au–Au or Au–Y bridge sites, depending on cluster
size and atomic arrangement. Average binding energy calcula-
tions reveal that the hydrogen adsorption on AunY (n = 4–12)
generally maintains higher relative stability compared to their
bare counterparts. Importantly, dissociative adsorption is
unlikely to occur for AunY (n = 1, 4–5, 8, 10) clusters without
external stimulation due to high energy barriers, while for n = 2,
3, 7, and 9 molecular adsorption is energetically preferred. Au6Y
and Au11Y clusters exhibit remarkable stability and barrier-free
dissociation pathways, making them promising candidates for
hydrogen dissociation and storage applications. Our results
provide a deeper insight into the interaction between H2 and
AunY clusters, including the adsorption site preference, the
stability of adsorption conguration, the eﬀect of impurities,
possible reaction pathways, and energy barriers involved with
this process. This work oﬀers valuable guidance for future
experiments and contributes to the development of alloys metal
clusters as fundamental components in the design of innovative
nanostructured materials for hydrogen catalysis and storage
applications.
