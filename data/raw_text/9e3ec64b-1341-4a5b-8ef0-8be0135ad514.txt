Modeling the impact of alloying on the hydrogenation properties of intermetallic compounds is a vital yet 
challenging task for hydrogen storage materials design: not only do these processes occur under thermodynamic 
para-equilibrium conditions, but for bcc-derived compounds, the task is further complicated through varying 
composition-dependent ordering transitions. Here, we tackle these challenges by providing a multicomponent 
thermodynamic modeling framework for FeTi, a representative bcc-derived material class, which is one of the 
most relevant room-temperature interstitial metal hydrides. We aim speciﬁcally to describe para-equilibrium in 
FeTi-based multicomponent hydrides while ensuring compatibility with previously evaluated metallic systems. 
DFT point-defect calculations provide a physics-informed foundation to identify substitutional site preferences. 
Not only does our approach give detailed guidance for the selection of model parameters to evaluate phase 
equilibria for a broad range of FeTi-based multicomponent systems with high fidelity, but it also can be easily 
adopted to other interstitial hydrogen storage compounds.
Hydrogen is attracting signiﬁcant attention as a next-generation en­
ergy carrier, particularly due to its high specific energy [1,2]. However, 
hydrogen gas has a poor volumetric energy density, and compressing 
or condensing it for storage requires considerable additional work and 
heat, rendering poor eﬃciency. As such, solid-state storage in the form 
of metal hydrides is notably promising [3]. Among metals that reversibly 
form hydrides, FeTi-based alloys are of particular interest, on account of 
their reversible hydrogenation at near-ambient temperatures and pres­
sures and readily available constituent elements [4].
Hydrogenation of metals is governed fundamentally by changes in 
entropy and enthalpy related to the formation of the hydride phase, 
which determines the temperature and pressure conditions needed dur­
ing operation [5]. Entropy contributions are primarily due to diﬀer­
ences between gas-phase H2 and atomic hydrogen within the crystal 
lattice [6]. Meanwhile, the enthalpy of hydrogenation depends mainly 
on the hydrogen ainity of constituent elements. Compositional tuning 
through alloying is therefore a valuable tool for tailoring the thermody­
namics of these materials for technological use. Multicomponent ther­
modynamic modeling is a well-suited approach to guide alloy design and

to evaluate the role of additives and impurities, including those origi­
nating from raw and recycled materials [10,11]. When modeling the 
thermodynamics of material systems, a primary consideration is how 
eﬀectively the model can be extrapolated to more complex systems. An 
example is the two-sublattice bcc order-disorder model [12], which de­
scribes both the bcc-derived A2 and B2 phases, containing one and two 
metal sublattices, respectively [Fig. 1(𝑎) and (𝑏)], with a single Gibbs 
energy expression. This model is just­fied because in many systems (e.g. 
Al-Fe-Ni [13], Cu-Zn [14], and Fe-Si [15]), the bcc phase can undergo a 
continuous ordering transition to B2, which characterizes it as a second­
order thermodynamic transition. In contrast, the transition in the Fe-Ti 
system has a first-order character and B2 can be modeled as a unique 
phase. Nevertheless, the model is usually employed to ensure compati­
bility and robust extrapolation to higher-order systems [7,16--20].
The hydrogenation of intermetallics often occurs in a state of partial 
equilibrium known as para-equilibrium. In this state, the alloy’s metal 
composition remains constant due to the sluggish diﬀusion of metal 
atoms at hydrogenation temperatures. Thus, only hydrogen equilibrates 
within the system, meaning that at para-equilibrium, each phase has the

same hydrogen chemical potential, while the chemical potential gradi­
ent of metallic species persists.
In AB metal-hydrogen systems, metals A and B are generally selected 
on the basis of their disparate hydrogen ainities [4], such that their as­
sociated binary hydrides are stable under a targeted range of conditions. 
This disparity in hydrogen ainity makes applying the order-disorder 
model to para-equilibrium in these systems even more complex. Incor­
porating interstitial hydrogen into the model must account for both the 
para-equilibrium state that governs hydrogenation of the intermetallic 
phase as well as the more stable complete-equilibrium state. This means 
that for the monohydride FeTiH in the Fe–Ti--H system, equilibrium be­
tween the intermetallic Laves phase, Fe2Ti, and the more stable binary 
hydride, TiH2, must be considered. Recently, we proposed the first ap­
proach to overcome this problem by treating interstitial hydrogen in 
the FeTi bcc phase after constraining the metallic form with the ana­
lytical derivation of the Gibbs energy for the perfectly ordered state of 
the bcc order-disorder model, requiring the resulting thermodynamic 
model to be compatible with the Fe–Ti system [21]. Even so, the suc­
cessful extrapolation of our model to multicomponent alloys remained 
elusive [22].
To treat the order-disorder transition in bcc-derived phases [23], the 
Gibbs energy model assumes two distinct contributions: one from the 
disordered phase (A2), and another from the energy Δ𝐺ord to form an 
ordered phase (B2). In the fully disordered state, the metallic sublattices 
are indistinguishable (i.e. they have identical atomic concentrations), 
whereas, in the ordered state, two metallic lattices are uniquely d­fined 
by their distinct compositions. We denote these two sublattices with 
superscripts ``(1)'' and ``(2)''; for A2, the single metallic sublattice is la­
beled ``(1)''. Hydrogen occupies a third, interstitial sublattice, denoted 
as ``(i)'', which can be described by the mixing of hydrogen atoms (H) 
and unoccupied interstices (□).

The total free energy of the bcc phase is finally expressed as:
𝐺bcc = 𝐺A2 + Δ𝐺ord.

Due to bcc symmetry, the following model parameters are equivalent:
𝐺B2
A∶B∶𝑖= 𝐺B2
B∶A∶𝑖;

𝐿B2
A,B∶𝑖∶𝑗= 𝐿B2
𝑖∶A,B∶𝑗;

𝐿B2
𝑖∶𝑗∶H,□= 𝐿B2
𝑗∶𝑖∶H,□.
(7)
As discussed, complications may arise if the metal elements have 
vastly diﬀerent hydrogen ainities. For instance, in the AB-H system, 
the hydride of element A may be highly unstable (𝐺A2
A∶H ≫0 and/or 
𝐿A2
𝐴∶□,𝐻≫0), while the hydride of B may be very stable (𝐺A2
B∶H ≪0
and/or 𝐿A2
𝐵∶□,𝐻≪0). As a result, modeling the interstitial solution 
within an equimolar AB bcc phase requires a complex combination of 
the binary and reciprocal lattice interaction parameters. Even if these 
parameters can be evaluated numerically, their physical meaning is un­
clear.
Figs. 1(𝑐) and (𝑑) illustrate the eﬀect of binary parameters on the 
ternary bcc phase in the Fe-Ti-H system. The stability diﬀerence between 
the binary Ti-H and Fe-H systems complicates the description of para­
equilibrium. Fig. 1(𝑐) shows the signiﬁcant binary contributions of the 
ordering enthalpy that aﬀect the shape of the internal-equilibrium Gibbs 
energy surface [Fig. 1(𝑑)]. The ordering enthalpy (Δ𝐻ord) is maximized 
for the equimolar composition, favoring the ordered state (B2) over the 
disordered state (A2). Similarly, the enthalpy of the metal-hydrogen so­
lution shifts the Gibbs energy surface of the bcc phase, maximizing it 
for the Fe-H binary system, and minimizing it for Ti-H.
Perfect metallic ordering in the bcc phase is achieved when the in­
terstitial lattice is unoccupied, while each metal element occupies a 
diﬀerent sublattice. Taking the example of an equimolar composition, 
the elemental fractions in the single sublattice of the A2 model are 
𝑦(1)
A = 𝑦(1)
B = 0.5, 𝑦(i)
□= 1, and 𝑦(i)
H = 0. If the equimolar bcc compound is 
paramagnetic under standard application temperatures (as in the case of 
bcc FeTi [29]), such that 𝐺mo ≈0, the resulting Gibbs energy expression 
for the A2 bcc phase (Equation (1)) becomes:
𝐺A2 =0.5𝐺A2
A∶□+ 0.5𝐺A2
B∶□
+ 𝑅𝑇(0.5ln0.5 + 0.5ln0.5)
+ 0.25𝐿A2
A,B∶□.
(8)
For the fully ordered B2 state, two possible symmetrically equivalent 
co­figurations generate an equimolar composition, i.e.(A)(1)
0.5(B)(2)
0.5(□)(i)
𝑏, 
and (B)(1)
0.5(A)(2)
0.5(□)(i)
𝑏. Taking the first co­figuration as an example, the 
sublattice compositions are 𝑦(1)
A = 𝑦(2)
B = 1, 𝑦(1)
B = 𝑦(2)
A = 0, 𝑦(i)
□= 1, and 
𝑦(i)
H = 0. Applying Equation (2) to these co­figurations leads to a dra­
matically reduced expression:
𝐺B2
ord = 𝐺B2
A∶B∶□.
(9)
Note that with no mixing in the sublattices, the binary ideal entropy of 
mixing is zero, i.e. lim𝑦𝑖→0
[𝑦𝑖ln𝑦𝑖+ (1 −𝑦𝑖)ln(1 −𝑦𝑖)] = 0.
For the same composition, in the fully disordered state, the B2 model 
has equimolar composition in both metallic sublattices: 𝑦(1)
A = 𝑦(2)
A = 0.5, 
𝑦(1)
B = 𝑦(2)
B = 0.5, 𝑦(i)
□= 1, and 𝑦(i)
H = 0. As a result, Equation (2) leads to:
𝐺B2
dis = + 0.5𝐺B2
A∶B∶□
+ 𝑅𝑇(0.5ln0.5 + 0.5ln0.5)
+ 0.25𝐿B2
A,B∶A∶□
+ 0.25𝐿B2
A,B∶B∶□.

are represented solely by their 0th-order terms, 0𝐿𝜙
𝑖,𝑗. Additionally, be­
cause the ordering contribution is referenced to the disordered phase, 
by deﬁnition, we have 𝐺B2
A∶A∶□= 𝐺B2
B∶B∶□= 0. The phase is instead ref­
erenced to the standard element reference (SER) energies through the 
A2 unary terms (𝐺A2
A∶□= 𝐺bcc

, and 𝐺A2
B∶□= 𝐺bcc

) [30]. 
Substituting Equations (8), (9), and (10) into Equation (4) then yields 
the general model for a perfectly ordered AB bcc system from the order­
disorder model:
𝐺bcc
A∶B∶□= + 0.5◦𝐺bcc

.
(12)
Note that immiscible bcc solutions have not yet been widely assessed in 
the literature, and appropriate parameters for the order-disorder model 
are not yet available. Moreover, calculations of hypothetical disordered 
bcc structures from first-principles are computationally demanding, con­
sidering the number of possible microstates for any given phase com­
position. In this case, however, the 0𝐿A2
A,B∶□interaction parameter from 
Equation (12) can be, as an initial approximation, taken from the Miede­
ma’s molar enthalpy of mixing (Δ ̄𝐻Miedema
mix
) [31--33]:

We now consider a dilute solution of some substitutional metal ele­
ment M within an ordered bcc structure containing interstitial hydrogen, 
which we call 𝛼. Equation (12) can be utilized for the end-members of 
the 𝛼phase, helping to describe the impact of adding M on the rele­
vant metallic sites. If M preferentially occupies the same sublattice as 
A, giving rise to the chemical formula (A,M)(1)

, is 
generally suﬃcient to describe dilute solutions accurately. In this case, 
the binary excess contributions 𝐿𝛼
A,M∶B∶𝑖may be neglected, but whether 
this assumption is reasonable depends on the specific system. The con­
tribution of the interaction expressed by the reciprocal lattice parameter 
𝐿A,M∶B∶H,□is likewise relatively unimportant: because it is multiplied 
by four fractional values in Equation (14), only an unrealistically large

value would eﬀectively i­fluence the Gibbs energy. Such large values 
should be avoided during model assessments.
Additionally, the mixing of hydrogen usually deviates from the ideal 
model due to the site-blocking eﬀect of hydrogen-hydrogen interac­
tions. Recent work demonstrated that the site-blocking eﬀect of unary 
interstitial element mixing can be more accurately described by the 
Johnson-Mehl-Avrami-Kolmogorov (JMAK) model [34], which is solely 
based on the number of sites blocked by the interstitial element. In 
this case, the terms corresponding to hydrogen’s ideal entropy of mix­
ing, 𝑅

, and excess contributions, 𝐿A∶B∶H,□and 
𝐿M∶B∶H,□, should be replaced by the JMAK description.
Lastly, the terms 𝐺bcc
𝑖∶𝑗∶H represent bcc structured compounds with 
the interstitial lattice fully occupied by hydrogen and can be expressed 
with the elemental reference energies as:
𝐺bcc
𝑖∶𝑗∶H = + 0.5

(15)
These compounds are generally not stable, making experimental de­
termination of their energetics unfeasible. Instead, their formation en­
thalpies Δ𝐻𝑓
𝑖∶𝑗∶H should be calculated from first principles [35], which 
results in an error of ≈10 kJmol−1 at room temperature [36]. The forma­
tion entropy Δ𝑆𝑓
𝑖∶𝑗∶H, which captures diﬀerences between gas-phase H2
and interstitial hydrogen, can be estimated as 130 J K−1 mol−1 H2 [6]. 
However, this estimate may require further r­finement to include sec­
ondary entropic contributions [5].
In FeTi, some elements preferentially substitute for either Fe or Ti, 
while other elements do not have a pronounced site preference. How­
ever, allowing the substitutional element M to occupy both sites in the 
thermodynamic model would require the evaluation of the binary M­
H system, due to the additional end-members that must be introduced 
in Equation (14), i.e. 𝐺bcc
M∶M∶□, and 𝐺bcc
M∶M∶H. As discussed previously, M 
metals may have a strong ainity to hydrogen and form highly stable hy­
drides, leading to 𝐺A2
M∶H ≪0 and/or 𝐿A2
M∶□,H ≪0 and thus reintroducing 
the problem of describing complete equilibrium and para-equilibrium 
simultaneously. Therefore, for relevant alloying species, we determine 
whether there is a preferred sublattice for substitution—and which one 
if so—by calculating point defect energies from first principles using 
density functional theory (DFT) [37,38]. Using first-principles calcula­
tions to this end provides an invaluable, physics-based foundation for 
our thermodynamic models, as it is often challenging to discern substi­
tutional preferences from experimental analysis precisely. We employ 
the generalized gradient approximation of Perdew, Burke, and Ernz­
erhof (PBE-GGA) to approximate the exchange-correlation functional 
[39]. More details on the DFT methodology are provided in the Sup­
porting Information (SI).
The formation energy 𝐸𝑓of an elemental defect 𝐷in a metallic 
system is given by [40]:
𝐸𝑓(𝐷) = 𝐸(𝐷) −𝐸bulk +
∑
𝑛A𝜇A.
(16)
Here, 𝐸(𝐷) is the total energy of a supercell containing 𝐷, 𝐸bulk is the 
total energy of a pristine supercell, and 𝑛A is the number of atoms of 
element A added (𝑛A < 0) or removed (𝑛A > 0) to create 𝐷. 𝜇A is the 
chemical potential of A, d­fined as 𝜇A = 𝐸tot(A) + Δ𝜇A, where 𝐸tot(A)
is the energy per atom of A in its reference phase, and Δ𝜇A represents 
an energy deviation from that reference. To prevent precipitation of the 
elemental phase, we require that Δ𝜇A ≤0.
Additional bounds on Δ𝜇A are set by ensuring thermodynamic sta­
bility of the reference phase. For FeTi, this condition corresponds to the 
equality:
Δ𝜇Fe + Δ𝜇Ti = Δ𝐻𝑓(FeTi),
(17)
where Δ𝐻𝑓(FeTi) is the enthalpy of formation of FeTi. We calcu­
late Δ𝐻𝑓(FeTi) = −0.83 eV per formula unit (−40 kJmol−1), which is

is possible, the more preferred site across the widest range of conditions is indi­
cated in parentheses.

slightly larger in magnitude than experimentally reported enthalpies 
[41] but agrees well with previous computational predictions [42]. 
Equation (17) allows us to select diﬀerent chemical potential condi­
tions for calculating formation energies; here, we focus on the Ti-rich 
(Δ𝜇Ti = 0) and Fe-rich (Δ𝜇Fe = 0) limits. For each species under consid­
eration, we have calculated the diﬀerence in formation energy between 
substitution on the Ti and Fe sites. These results show quantitatively 
how much more preferable substitution will be on one sublattice com­
pared to the other, and whether that substitution depends on chemical 
potential conditions.
We visualize our results in Fig. 2 by highlighting elements on the Pe­
riodic Table based on their substitutional preference. Elements shaded 
dark blue or red have a pronounced energetic preference for the Ti or 
Fe sites, respectively, under all conditions. Lighter-shaded elements still 
generally prefer one site over the other, but they may substitute on the 
opposite site under certain conditions, which are diﬃcult to specify pre­
cisely because the metal atom chemical potentials defining the ``Ti-rich'' 
and ``Fe-rich'' limits cannot easily be measured in experiments. The for­
mation energy diﬀerences underlying our results shown in Fig. 2 are 
listed in Table 1.
The site preference for incorporation is strongly dependent on the 
element. Generally, larger species such as Sc, Y, and Zr will prefer to 
substitute for Ti, while smaller cations such as Mn, Co, and Ni prefer to 
substitute for Fe. Very similar trends can be found for substitution in the 
FeTiH monohydride (Table S1) and Fe2Ti C14 Laves phases (Table S2). 
We find that our predicted site preferences align well with previous 
ﬁndings [4,51--53], along with calculated phase diagrams of selected Fe--
Ti--M ternary systems (Fig. 3) that are based on compiled experimental 
and computational data [16--20]. Co, Cr, Mn, and Ni [Fig. 3(𝑎)--(𝑑)] each 
display high solubility on the Fe site, based on the continuous, single­
phase region for FeTi apparent for a fixed Ti mole fraction of 0.5 (shaded 
blue). For Co and Ni, this region persists up to complete substitution 
for Fe. Correspondingly, our calculated relative formation energies in 
Table 1 show Fe substitution to be preferred for each of these elements; 
furthermore, we find Co and Ni to have the greatest energetic preference 
for Fe-site substitution among the elements we consider. Conversely, 
the phase diagram for Ti–Fe--V [Fig. 3(𝑒)] shows solubility of V on both 
Ti and Fe sites, again agreeing with our formation energy calculations. 
As an aside, the phase diagrams also show signiﬁcant solubility on Fe 
sites in Fe2Ti Laves phase (magenta shaded regions in Fig. 3), also in 
agreement with our formation energy calculations (Table S2).

Fig. 2. Periodic Table of the Elements indicating the site preference for substitutional species in FeTi, based on data in Table 1. Blue-shaded elements prefer to 
substitute for Ti, while red-shaded elements prefer to substitute for Fe. Lighter shading indicates that substitution on the other site may be preferred under certain 
conditions. For ease of viewing, the lanthanides and actinides are not depicted. (For interpretation of the colors in the figure(s), the reader is referred to the web

Continuous, single-phase regions are highlighted for the B2 phase (blue) and C14 Laves phase (magenta).
In accordance with our predicted site preferences, we have collected 
the parameters necessary to evaluate Equation (12) from thermody­
namic data available in the literature. We report these parameters in 
Table 2 and Table 3 for substitution on the Ti and Fe sublattices, respec­
tively. For V, we provide values both for substitution on the Ti sublattice 
and on the Fe sublattice, allowing the reader to choose the more rele­
vant site based on the conditions of interest.
We note that these evaluations capture only one end of para­
equilibrium, namely, the metallic reference of the ordered bcc alloy. 
To complete the model for hydrogenation of the AB alloy, a similar pro­
cedure must be followed for the hydride phase, ABH. To that end, the 
formation energies reported in Table S1 can be used to simplify the 
selection of end-member compounds, and first-principles calculations 
can be used to compute formation enthalpies (analogously to Equa­

tion (15)). Then, after merging these formation enthalpies into the base 
model for the hydride phase (Equation 6 in Ref. [21])-including pre­
viously calculated Gibbs energies and binary interaction parameters as 
a starting point—the temperature and pressure conditions necessary for 
para-equilibrium between the metal and its hydride can be estimated. 
Ultimately, this approach can enable proper evaluation of the role diﬀer­
ent alloying elements play in determining hydrogen storage properties.
In conclusion, we have proposed a model informed by first-principles 
calculations that enables the description of para-equilibrium in mul­
ticomponent AB metal hydride systems. Our point defect formation 
energy calculations demonstrated the site preference for diﬀerent substi­
tutional elements, which in turn determines the appropriate sublattice 
model for constructing a streamlined thermodynamic reference expres­
sion and modeling the Gibbs energy of the ordered bcc phase. We 
validated the accuracy of these computational predictions through com­
parison with phase diagrams. Our approach improves the assessment 
of para-equilibrium conditions by circumventing spurious contributions 
from the most stable binary bcc hydrides (e.g., Ti–H within the Fe–Ti--H 
system). The consistency of our proposed models with previously as­
sessed thermodynamic parameters enables the prediction of materials 
interactions beyond simple chemical intuition. A further advantage of 
our approach is that it establishes a direct relationship between phase 
composition and sublattice composition. Such a relationship facilitates 
the integration of these models into future work in the area of multi­
scale simulations of metal hydride materials [54--57]. We expect that our 
model will be valuable for thermodynamic assessments of FeTi-based 
alloys for hydrogen storage, thereby accelerating their development in 
large-scale energy storage applications.
