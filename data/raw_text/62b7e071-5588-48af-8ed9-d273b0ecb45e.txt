Metal hydrides are considered as an important group of materials in the future hydrogen-based economy. 
Their development is mostly based on time-consuming experimental trial-and-error methods. This work 
accelerates this pathway using a computational framework for the thermodynamic modeling of metal 
hydrides under para-equilibrium conditions. By employing the CALPHAD method on a six-component AB5-type 
(Ce, La)(Ni, Al, Fe, Mn)5–H system, we are able to make precise predictions regarding hydrogen absorption 
enthalpies, plateau pressures, and hydrogen sorption capacities. Additionally, this is the first time the 
hydrogenation/dehydroganation hysteresis effect has been successfully modeled using separate thermodynamic 
databases for hydrogen absorption and desorption. Furthermore, we introduce a method to directly calculate 
sloped pressure–composition–temperature (PCT) curves from X-ray diffraction data. This validation demon-
strates the framework’s capability to assess the hydrogen storage properties of complex multi-component 
systems in an efficient manner. This work lays the groundwork for future metal hydride thermodynamic 
studies on a variety of material classes, as well as optimization of alloys for applications even beyond classical 
hydrogen storage.
1. Introduction
Hydrogen plays a crucial role in the shift towards sustainable energy 
systems due to its clean energy potential and versatile applications. 
Nevertheless, the issue of efficient and safe hydrogen storage remains 
a significant challenge. Metal hydrides, such as AB5-type alloys, offer 
a promising solution, enabling reversible hydrogen storage at rea-
sonable pressures and temperatures [1–3]. The storage properties are 
critical because hydrogen storage must be feasible under conditions 
that align with practical applications, such as ambient or moderately 
elevated temperatures and pressures suitable for transportation and 
stationary applications. Moreover, metal hydrides have proven valuable 
in hydrogen compression, thermal management systems and hydro-
gen purification showcasing their versatility beyond classical storage 
applications [4,5]. By substituting elements on the A and B sites, 
the hydrogenation properties of AB5-type alloys – including plateau 
pressures, hydrogen capacity, and reaction enthalpy – can be precisely 
tuned and therefore optimized for specific applications [2].
The necessity of modeling these sorption properties with computa-
tional tools is apparent from the considerable amount of recent research

in this field [1,6]. The complex multi-component nature of metal 
hydrides presents a significant challenge in predicting their behavior. 
The CALPHAD (CALculation of PHAse Diagrams) method is a long-
established approach for modeling and predicting the thermodynamic 
properties of such systems [7]. As it integrates both experimental 
data and thermodynamic principles, the incorporation of predictive 
tools such as density functional theory further enhances its capability 
for future advancements in the field. This combination allows for a 
substantial reduction in the experimental effort required to identify 
new alloy compositions and material classes for hydrogen applications, 
with the potential for a transformative impact on metal hydride-based 
research.
Recently, the authors published a computational tool to calcu-
late the challenging para-equilibrium state and assess experimental 
data in a more automated procedure [8]. It was introduced on a 
basic ternary (Ce,La)Ni5–H system. To further validate the proposed 
method, in the current work we chose the six-component
(Ce,La)(Ni,Al,Fe,Mn)5–H system, as it finds significant relevance in the 
metal hydride field and sufficient experimental data is present. Here we

focus on the important hydrogenation characteristics from a practical 
point of view. This includes the pressure–composition–temperature 
triplets (seen on an ideal stoichiometric alloy) and, for the first time, 
the prediction of pressure hysteresis between the absorption and des-
orption process as well as the plateau slope of non-stoichiometric 
alloys.
To address these challenges, this work includes the following con-
tributions:
1. A step-by-step guide on modeling and predicting ideal hydro-
genation properties of multi-component metal-hydride systems 
within the CALPHAD framework and the recently published 
program [8].
2. A novel approach to model the hysteresis of the absorption and 
desorption processes.
3. A new framework to incorporate X-ray diffraction (XRD) mea-
surements into the CALPHAD method for predicting sloping 
plateaus.

2. Design process
2.1. Design parameters
To meet the diverse requirements of different applications of metal 
hydrides, a modeling tool needs to be able to predict and optimize a 
complex set of sorption properties. In our case, we want to optimize 
an alloy for a thermochemical systems. Therefore, we aimed to design 
an AB5 alloy with the desired hydrogen sorption properties - a high 
hydrogen capacity together with a high reaction enthalpy. First we 
established the compositional boundaries for the AB5 metal phase (ex-
cluding hydrogen) (see Table 1). Within these boundaries, we modeled 
key hydrogenation properties, including hydrogen capacity at specific 
pressures and temperatures, plateau pressure, and reaction enthalpy. 
Furthermore, coupling of this thermodynamic model with the phase 
stability limits allowed us to optimize the alloy compositions to achieve 
the desired hydrogen storage properties.
2.1.1. Stability of the AB5 metal phase
The 
only 
stable 
binary 
alloys 
within 
the 
investigated
(Ce,La)(Ni,Al,Fe,Mn)5 system are CeNi5 and LaNi5. They both crystal-
lize in the P6/mmm phase and are at room temperature approximately 
stoichiometric compounds [9]. La and Ce are fully soluble on the A 
site (in AB5-type alloy), allowing complete substitution of one for the 
other [10]. Contrary to the A site elements, the substitution of Ni on the 
B site is limited in the ternary LaNi5-xMx and CeNi5-xMx phases (with 
M = Al, Fe, Mn). The boundaries for the B-side substitution of Ni were 
investigated thoroughly, elsewhere [2]. The substitutional limits of Al, 
Fe, and Mn in the LaNi5-xMx phase are summarized in Table 1.
For the CeNi5-xAlx system, the substitutional limits are reported to 
be higher than for the LaNi5-xAlx system. Yamagishi et al. observed 
stable CeNi5-xAlx alloys with 𝑥 up to 2 [11]. Noticeably the lattice 
parameters have a discontinuity at around 𝑥 = 1 to 1.25 and the 
hydrogenation properties start to degrade drastically. This means, al-
though the CeNi5-xAlx metal phase seems to have a higher solubility 
limit than the LaNi5-xAlx phase, the hydride phase remains unstable 
above CeNi3.75Al1.25Hx. Due to the lack of available experimental data 
for the other CeNi5-xMx systems and the inconsistencies reported in 
the CeNi5-xAlx system, we leveraged the chemical similarity of La 
and Ce (for example similar ionic radii and electronic configuration) 
and develop the design rule based on the LaNi5-xMx systems (Table 
1). The substitutional limit xtotal of a hypothetical multicomponent 
(Ce,La)Ni5-x,iMx,i alloy with i components equals to 
𝑥total =

where 𝑥𝑖 is the number of atoms per formula unit of the substitutional 
element 𝑖, and 𝑥limit,𝑖 is the substitutional limit of this element. Thus, 
assuming a linear dependence of phase stability on xtotal, any alloy 
composition with a substitutional element ratio resulting in 𝑥total ≤1 is 
expected to retain a stable, single-phase P6/mmm structure. Composi-
tions with 𝑥total > 1 will likely result in the formation of secondary 
phases. The formulation of Eq. (1) with the experimental values of 
Table 1 yields a composition of CexLa1-xNi3.59Al0.47Fe0.47Mn0.47 (based 
on an equimolar ratio among the substitutional elements — Al, Fe, Mn), 
which approaches the threshold of 𝑥total = 1. Any further increase in the 
substitutional element content beyond this composition would exceed 
the threshold and likely lead to the formation of secondary phases.
2.1.2. Thermodynamic modeling of the hydride phase
Within the defined substitutional limits of the metal phase the 
hydrogenated phase can be described by the hexagonal P63mc struc-
ture [15]. To model the hydrogenation properties of the
metal-hydrogen system, the Compound–Energy–Formalism within the 
CALPHAD framework was adopted [16]. The modeling process and 
the associated program were described in a previous paper by the 
authors [8]. In addition to the sorption properties that can be derived 
from the phase diagram (pressure–composition–temperature (PCT)
triplets), the authors demonstrate a methodology for modeling the 
sloped PCT isotherms of non-stoichiometric compounds and the hys-
teresis of the absorption and desorption process (see below).
2.1.3. Ideal sorption properties
To establish a foundation for predicting the complete PCT curve, 
including hysteresis and slope characteristics, it is essential to first 
model the sorption properties of ideal, stoichiometric compounds.
The PCT relationship can be calculated by the partial equilibrium 
of the (temperature- and pressure-dependent) Gibbs energy curve of 
the metal-hydride phase and the hydrogen gas phase. The CALPHAD 
method extrapolates these equilibria from thermodynamic quantities: 
The enthalpy and entropy of formation, 𝐻𝑓 and 𝑆𝑓, the mixing en-
thalpy 𝐻mix and the configurational entropy 𝑆conf, which are subse-
quently used to calculate the Gibbs energy curve for the metal-hydride 
phase 𝐺MH:
𝐺MH(𝐜, 𝑇) = 𝐻𝑓(𝐜, 𝑇) −𝑇⋅𝑆𝑓(𝐜, 𝑇) + 𝐻mix(𝐜, 𝑇) −𝑇⋅𝑆conf(𝐜, 𝑇)
(2)
Here, c represents the composition vector, consisting of the molar 
fractions of the metal elements and hydrogen.
The AB5(H,Va)1(H,Va)6 sublattice model described by Hannappel 
et al. is used, as it shows good capabilities of modeling the sorption 
properties within the Ce1-xLaxNi5-H system [8,17,18]. Here, Va stands 
for vacancies and therefore (H,Va) is a hydrogen-vacancy sublattice.
The first assessment is done on experimental data, where absorption 
and desorption data are present. The logarithmic mean of the pressure 
values and the linear mean of the capacities are used to optimize the 
size and values of the thermodynamic database.
2.1.4. Hysteresis
Multiple theories for the origin of the differences between hydro-
gen absorption and desorption curves were developed. One of them, 
formulated by Schwarz and Khachaturyan, relates the hysteresis to an 
energetic barrier resulting from the elastic stresses created during the 
phase transition (from metallic phase to the hydride phase) [19]. This 
assumes that the E-Modulus and the mismatch in the unit cell sizes of 
the metal and hydride phase correlates directly with the hysteresis.

Fig. 1. Schematic representation of the proposed method for converting XRD microstrain data into sloped PCT curves. The diffraction angle-dependent peak broadening is correlated 
with microstrain, which is then converted into a Gaussian distribution of compositions (phase width, Eqs. (4)–(6)). Finally, the distribution of composition vectors is transformed 
into a sloped plateau by superimposing multiple ideal PCT curves (Eq. (8)).
In contrary, Flanagan and Clewley related the hysteresis to the 
inelastic stresses. In this case, dislocations must be formed due to the 
size mismatches during phase transition [20]. Therefore, the hysteresis 
scales with the number of dislocations and the formation enthalpy of 
the dislocations.
In any way, the different sorption pressures for absorption and 
desorption can be translated to a difference in the Gibbs energy for 
absorption and desorption: 
1
2𝑘𝑇ln
( 𝑝abs
𝑔
𝑝des
𝑔
)
= 𝛿𝐺abs
𝛿𝑁H
−𝛿𝐺des
𝛿𝑁H
(3)
Here, 𝑝g is the partial pressure of the hydrogen gas and 𝑁H is the 
amount of hydrogen in mole. The hysteresis can now be modeled with 
the CALPHAD method by generating two parameter sets that represent 
the Gibbs energy of the metal hydride during hydrogen absorption and 
desorption, 𝐺abs and 𝐺des, respectively. Elastic and inelastic stresses 
primarily affect the enthalpy due to the energy stored in lattice distor-
tions and dislocation formation, which directly impact the Gibbs energy 
surface of the system. Therefore, we fix the entropy for both absorption 
and desorption to that of the standard entropy of hydrogen gas (130 
J/mol-H2K) and allow the enthalpy of formation and mixing enthalpy 
to be optimized between absorption and desorption [21].
While it is questionable whether a thermodynamic modeling tool 
can meaningfully predict kinetic effects, this is the first known attempt 
to use such a method. From a practical perspective, this approach al-
lows to model the relevant observable sorption properties, and to select 
on this basis the optimized materials with predetermined hydrogen 
storage properties.
2.1.5. Plateau slope
The slope of the pressure plateau is an application-relevant sorption 
property. In many application scenarios, the slope significantly limits 
the usable capacity. The origin of the plateau slope is commonly 
attributed to a distribution of the alloy composition around the nominal 
stoichiometry [22]. This means the sloped plateau is a superposition 
of several plateaus corresponding to compositions slightly deviating 
from the nominal one. By extracting information about the microstrain 
distribution from XRD data and combining it with a thermodynamic 
model, the slope can be quantitatively predicted. Here, we briefly 
describe the method to get sloped PCT curves from XRD measurements, 
which is schematically shown in Fig. 1 and described in the following 
paragraphs.
According to the TOPAS reference manual [23], the refined mi-
crostrain parameter 𝜖0 obtained from the Double Voigt approach (cf. 
Materials and Methods section) is defined as the distribution width 
within which 50 % of the material’s microstrain values are found. As 
long as the nominal alloy composition is not near a substitutional limit, 
it is reasonable to assume that the compositional distribution adheres to 
Gaussian statistics (as anisotropic microstrain broadening has not been 
observed). In Gaussian normal distributions, 50 % of the area under the 
curve lies within ±0.6745𝜎. 
𝜖0 = 𝛥𝑑
𝑑0
= 0.6745 ⋅𝜎
(4)
Here, 𝛥𝑑 is the distorted lattice parameter, 𝑑0 is the lattice param-
eter of the nominal composition, and 𝜎 the standard deviation.
Microstrain is usually correlated to defects, such as vacancies, dis-
locations, or impurity atoms. With XRD measurements on the stoichio-
metric LaNi5 and CeNi5 compounds, the influence of dislocations on the 
peak broadening (introduced during alloy preparation) is quantified. 
This results in a correlation of the magnitude of the distorted lattice 
parameter with the phase width.
In the hexagonal unit cell of the P6/mmm phase, only the lattice 
parameters a and c are independent, with other parameters being 
constrained by symmetry. Therefore, 𝜖0 can be translated to a Gaussian 
distribution of the phase width 𝑃𝑊 with the boundary conditions: 
𝜖0,𝑎+ 𝜖0,𝑐
2
= 𝜖0
(5)
and 
𝜎PW(𝜖0,𝑎) = 𝜎PW(𝜖0,𝑐)
(6)
In Chapter S1 of the Supplementary Information (SI), the depen-
dence of the lattice parameters a and c on the chemical composition 
of the ternary systems is presented. From the ternary systems, we can 
extrapolate linearly to the mean change of the lattice parameter in 
dependence on the nominal composition:
𝛥𝑑(̄𝑥) =
∑
𝐴
(
𝑥𝐴
∑
𝐵≠Ni
(𝑥𝐵𝛥𝑑(𝑥𝐴Ni5−𝑥𝐵𝑥)))
+ ∑
𝐴≠Ce
(𝑥𝐴𝛥𝑑(𝑥Ce1−𝑥A𝑥Ni5))
(∑
𝐴≠Ce,𝐵≠Ni 𝑥𝑖
)
(7)
Here, 𝑥𝑖 is the atomic fraction of the component 𝑖, on the 𝐴 or 𝐵 site, 
and 𝛥𝑑(𝑥ternary) is the change in the lattice parameter per atom change 
in the ternary systems, as summarized in Table 2. This equation results 
in a mean change of the lattice parameter 𝑎 or 𝑐 per mean atom ̄𝑥. A 
detailed expression of this equation for the applied multi-component 
system is given in Chapter S1 in the SI.
Once the parameter 𝜎PW is determined, the sloping PCT curve is 
calculated by weighting the ideal stoichiometric PCT curves with the 
probabilities of the Gaussian function: 
𝑐H =
∑
𝑖
𝑐H,𝑖⋅𝑝𝑖
(8)
where 𝑐𝐻,𝑖 is the capacity of an ideal stoichiometric alloy with com-
position 𝑖, and 𝑝𝑖 is the probability of the composition 𝑖 within the 
distribution of the non-ideal alloy from Eq. (4).

2.1.6. Review of existing experimental data
By extracting hydrogen sorption properties of quasi-binary
(CeNi5–H, LaNi5–H) and quasi-ternary (Ce1-xLaxNi5–H, LaNi5-xMx–H,
CeNi5-xMx–H) systems, the thermodynamic database is build. This 
database enables extrapolation to higher-order multicomponent sys-
tems.
A summary of the hydrogen sorption properties of the (Ce,La)Ni5-H 
system has been made by Hannappel et al. [8]. The substitution of Al, 
Fe and Mn for Ni reduces the plateau pressure and the hydrogen storage 
capacity. Additionally, the substitution of Ni in the La(Ni,Al,Fe,Mn)5
system increases the hysteresis. Contrary, in the Ce(Ni,Al,Fe,Mn)5 sys-
tem the substitution of Ni with Al, Fe and Mn is reducing the hystere-
sis [12,14,24,25].
PCT data for the optimization of two quasi-binary systems
(CeNi5–H and LaNi5–H) and 5 ternary systems (La(Ni,Al)5–H,
Ce(Ni,Al)5–H, La(Ni,Mn)5–H, Ce(Ni,Mn)5–H, La(Ni,Fe)5–H) were taken 
from the literature [8–12,14,24–34].
In the evaluated ternary systems within the LaNi5-xMx – system, data 
over sufficient ranges of composition and temperature are available. 
For the complementary CeNi5-xMx – system data is scarce. This is partic-
ularly critical for the CeNi5-xFex – system, where no experimental data 
is available. While an option would be to take higher order systems into 
account for the optimization (e.g. the Ce1-xLaxNi5-yFey – system [32]) 
the current state of the assessment program does not include this func-
tionality. Another possibility is to calculate the missing thermodynamic 
parameters from first-principle calculations. Because of the chemical 
similarity of Ce and La, the authors decided to mitigate this prob-
lem by choosing for the CeNi5-xFex – system the same thermodynamic 
parameters as for the LaNi5-xFex – system.
3. Materials and methods
The following synthesis and materials characterization were con-
ducted to determine the proper experimental data for validating the 
predictions on the material properties, derived from the design process 
described in Section 2.
3.1. Material selection
Three material compositions were examined to validate the preci-
sion of the thermodynamic model in different positions in the
(Ce,La)(Ni,Al,Fe,Mn)5 compositional space. First, the model was used 
to find an alloy composition optimized to be used as a thermochemical 
heat source. Two boundary conditions were applied:
1. Plateau pressure during desorption at 333 K of 1 bar.
2. Maximize the enthalpy capacity during absorption.
The enthalpy capacity 𝐻𝑐 is defined as 
𝐻𝑐= 𝛥𝐻⋅𝑛H2,𝑝
(9)
Here, 𝛥𝐻 is the partial molar enthalpy of hydrogen in the plateau 
region in kJ/molH2, and 𝑛H2,𝑝 is the hydrogen capacity at a certain 
pressure p in molH2/gmetal. The partial molar enthalpy of hydrogen 
can be calculated with the van’t Hoff equation [35]. These bound-
ary conditions yield an optimized Alloy_1 (see below) composition 
of (Ce0.1La0.9)(Ni4.47Al0.06Fe0.2Mn0.27), with an enthalpy capacity of 
0.21 kJ/gmetal at 40 bar.
Additionally, the boundaries of the model are evaluated by cast-
ing Alloy_2 and Alloy_3, which incorporate high amounts of B-side 
substitution elements Al, Fe, and Mn, with total substitution values 
of 𝑥total = 0.85 for Alloy_2 and 𝑥total = 1.07 for Alloy_3 (one alloy 
exceeding and one not exceeding the substitution threshold — see Eq. 
(1)).
In conclusion, three compositions are examined for validating the 
thermodynamic model within the (Ce,La)(Ni,Al,Fe,Mn)5–H system:
1. (Ce0.1La0.9)(Ni4.47Al0.06Fe0.2Mn0.27) (𝐻𝑐= 0.21 kJ/g)
2. (Ce0.65La0.35)(Ni3.8Al0.4Fe0.4Mn0.4) (xtotal = 0.85)
3. (Ce0.65La0.35)(Ni3.5Al0.5Fe0.5Mn0.5) (xtotal = 1.07)
Each of the three compositions are evaluated in two states: as-
cast and heat-treated. Therefore, a total of six distinct samples are 
examined in this study, labeled as Alloy_x_y, where 𝑥 reflects the 
chemical composition number (1, 2 or 3) and 𝑦 the alloy state (as-cast 
or heat-treated). This approach allows for comprehensive validation of 
the thermodynamic model within the (Ce,La)(Ni,Al,Fe,Mn)5–H system.
3.2. Material synthesis
The samples were synthesized from high-purity elemental met-
als: Ce (99.9%, Osnabruegge GmbH), La (99.9%, VWR International 
GmbH), Ni (99.95%, Thermo Fisher GmbH), Al (99.9%, Thermo Fisher 
GmbH), Fe (99.97%, Thermo Fisher GmbH) and Mn (99.9%, Thermo 
Fisher GmbH). Metal pieces ranging from 1...10mm were used. The 
arc-melting method was employed under an argon atmosphere with 
an actively cooled Cu-crucible (AM500, Edmund Bühler GmbH). The 
metals were melted three times per side for two minutes and flipped in 
between.
Additionally, one-half of the as-cast samples were heat-treated un-
der Argon atmosphere at 1273 K for 7 days (Alloy_x_heat-treated). The 
heat treatment leads to cast homogenization and, therefore, reduces 
the microstrain. These samples were used to examine the change of 
plateau slope due to the annealing process. The samples were stored 
and prepared in an inert argon atmosphere.
The single-phase crystal structure and oxygen impurities
were proven with XRD analysis and Hot Gas Extraction (Fig. 4 and 
Supplementary Information, Section S2).
3.3. X-ray diffraction
XRD was conducted on as-cast and heat treated samples using 
Empyrean diffractometer (Malvern Panalytical GmbH, Mo-K𝛼-radiation 
(𝜆K𝛼1
=
0.713609 Å, 𝜆K𝛼2

7.167 ◦), Anti-scatter slit: 1∕2◦, Divergence slit: 1∕8◦, Primary Soller 
slit: 0.02 rad, Secondary Soller slit: 0.04 rad) and the obtained data 
were analyzed using the Rietveld method.
Rietveld refinements of the diffraction data were performed using 
TOPAS 5 software [23] employing the fundamental parameters ap-
proach. All fundamental parameters were kept constant for different 
refinements. Crystallite size (CS) and strain microstructure effects (𝜖0) 
were separated using the Double Voigt approach which utilizes convo-
lutions of a Gaussian and Lorentzian profile function for both crystallite 
size and strain. Anisotropic microstructure broadening was negligible 
and therefore disregarded. To increase refinement reliabilities and 
differential precision of refined values, only a minimum set of variables

rameters to describe the preferred orientation of crystallites and scale 
factors. Site occupancies and atomic positions were kept fixed. All 
refinements were carefully checked for any parameter correlations. 
Any residual correlations between Gaussian contributions of strain and 
crystallite size were less or equal 62 % for all refinements. All other 
refined variables were correlated by less than 81 %. All refinements 
yielded good agreement between the observed and calculated patterns. 
𝜒2 (𝑅wp∕𝑅exp) of the refinements were between 5.30 and 6.95.
To introduce during preparation as little external strain as possible, 
the samples were manually ground in small batches and sieved with a 
65 μm sieve. The material that passed through the sieve was collected, 
while the coarser fraction with the particle size remaining above 65 μm 
was carefully crushed and sieved again until 80 % of the material 
passed. Since this poses the risk of separating different phases, initial 
tests were conducted with and without sieving, and no phase separation 
was detected.
3.4. Sorption measurements
The samples were activated by alternating cycles of high (above 
plateau pressure) hydrogen pressure and vacuum at 293 K until no 
difference in the measured capacities could be observed. Between each 
cycle, the vacuum (10−3 Pa) was maintained for at least 30 min. Hydro-
gen sorption tests were conducted by detecting the weight differences 
during sorption. The threshold to define equilibrium was set as a mass 
change rate of 10 μg/min over a period of 10 min. This equals a relative 
mass change of 5 × 10−3 wt.% per minute. Each of the six Alloy_x_y 
were measured at three different temperatures. The experiments were 
performed up to 80 bar at different temperatures using a magnetic 
suspension balance (Waters GmbH). These experiments are used to 
calculate the reaction enthalpy by applying the van’t Hoff equation. 
The sample preparation was done in air as a bulk piece of around 2 g.
4. Results and discussion
This chapter presents the results of modeling available experimental 
data (from the literature) using a recently published program [8]. 
Then the model predictions are evaluated with the properties of all six 
Alloy_x_y: in terms of pressure, capacity and reaction enthalpy. Last, 
the proposed technique to predict the pressure hysteresis and plateau 
slope is analyzed.
4.1. Modeling results
The digitized database is available in the supplementary material 
and in table format in Chapter S3 in the SI. A detailed comparison of 
the calculated sorption properties with the experimental training data 
is given in Figure S3 in the SI.
The seven evaluated systems (CeNi5-xMx and LaNi5-xMx (with M = 
Al, Fe, Mn) and Ce1-xLaxNi5) produced 4031 different parameter sets 
with a calculation effort of 22,394 core hours. The Arcaice Information 
Criterion algorithm to compensate for excessive use of interactive 
parameters results in a maximum of four interaction terms in the 
quasi-binary LaAl5-H system and three interaction terms in the quasi-
ternary La(Ni,Al)5-H system. Contrarily for the LaMn5-H, CeMn5-H, 
La(Ni,Mn)5-H and Ce(Ni,Mn)5-H systems, only one interaction param-
eter is needed to represent each experimental data set. In total, 54 
parameters were assessed to describe the 6-component system.
4.2. Prediction of PCT curves
The PCT curves for the six different Alloys_x_y are plotted in Fig. 
2 The most important data has been summarized in Table 3 and 
visualized in Fig. 3. The results of hydrogen absorption/desorption 
experiments performed at other temperatures can be found in Chapter 
S4 the SI. As expected, the plateau pressures and hydrogen capacities 
are similar between the as-cast and heat-treated samples Fig. 2. The

Fig. 3. Capacity, absorption pressure, reaction enthalpy and hysteresis factor measured 
and modeled for three studied alloys (in two stats: as-cast and heat-treated). Capacity 
and reaction enthalpy changes approximately linearly, while the plateau pressure 
changes exponentially with composition. The model is not predicting the diminishing 
hysteresis in the highly substituted samples (2–3).
main difference is the sloping of the PCT curve, which is much stronger 
for the as-cast samples than for the heat-treated ones.
Overall, the heat-treated samples show greater consistency with 
the CALPHAD model than the as-cast alloys. Although most of the 
experimental input data taken from literature is not annealed, the ther-
modynamic model predicts quantities regarding their thermodynamic 
(para-) equilibrium. Therefore, it is logical, that the annealed samples 
are closer to the equilibrated state.
The (Ce0.1La0.9)(Ni4.47Al0.06Fe0.2Mn0.27) alloy samples (as-cast and 
heat-treated) with the lowest substitution content (xtotal  =  0.53) show 
the most precise results regarding the hydrogen capacity with a mean 
error of 3 % (see Table 3). The reaction enthalpy is predicted with 
a similar error. When looking at the target variable for Alloy_1, the 
enthalpy capacity 𝐻𝑐, we predicted this value with an accuracy of 1 % 
for the as-cast and 5 % for the heat-treated sample. This underlines 
the ability of the methodology, to predict alloys precisely for diverse 
hydrogen applications.
The prediction accuracy evolves differently for the distinct sorption 
properties, when going to higher amounts of substitutional elements 
(Alloy_2 and 3). The main strength of the computational method is 
the ability of modeling the plateau pressures. Even with substitution 
amounts close to the boundary of phase stability (𝑥total ∼1), the 
errors of the predicted absorption pressures are very small. Espe-
cially for the heat-treated samples, which resemble the more equili-
brated state, the errors for the (Ce0.65La0.35)(Ni3.8Al0.4Fe0.4Mn0.4) and 
(Ce0.65La0.35)(Ni3.5Al0.5Fe0.5Mn0.5) samples are 4 % and 1 %, respec-
tively (see Table 3). The fact, that only binary interaction parameters 
are included for quasi-binary and -ternary systems underlines the abil-
ity of the CALPHAD method to extrapolate the sorption properties to 
higher-order systems.
The reaction enthalpy is deduced from the measurements of the 
absorption plateau pressures, which is why the prediction shows similar 
trends as for the absorption plateau pressures.
The error of the predicted hydrogen capacities is increasing with 
higher substitutional contents (2–4 % for (Ce0.1La0.9)(Ni4.47Al0.06Fe0.2
Mn0.27), 10–13 % for (Ce0.65La0.35)(Ni3.5Al0.5Fe0.5Mn0.5), see Table 3). 
While the largest error is at 13 %, this trend underlines the observation 
made in our previous work, that modeling of the plateau boundaries 
(phase boundaries of the alpha and beta phase) is a much more difficult 
task [17].
The model for the AB5 system was expanded to better represent 
the plateau boundaries, evolving from an (A)(B)5(H,Va)7 sublattice 
model [17,18] to an (A)(B)5(H,Va)1(H,Va)6 configuration [8]. Possibly 
a more complex structure, where either the B side or the (H,Va)6 site 
can be split into their distinct Wyckoff sites 6c1 and 6c2, could improve 
this capability even more. As the number of model parameters rises 
exponentially (∼2𝑛) with the increase of the number of sublattices 
𝑛, while experimental data stays scarce, additional ab initio data is 
necessary to fill the parameters with physically meaningful quantities. 
Already with this sublattice model, the utilized parameter set is mini-
mal compared to the vast parameter space, suggesting that the model 
may be overly complex and potentially overparameterized for the 
available data. Therefore, adding more hydrogen-vacancy sublattices 
will result in optimization problems due to overfitting.
4.3. Modeling of the pressure hysteresis
The best prediction regarding the pressure hysteresis shows the 
Alloy_1 with composition (Ce0.1La0.9)(Ni4.47Al0.06Fe0.2Mn0.27) (Fig. 2a 
and Fig. 3) . Here, the heat-treated sample has an error of 10 % (see 
Table 3). In general, the heat-treated samples show a higher hysteresis 
factor, than the as-cast materials. It must be emphasized that the alloys 
have been properly activated until no changes in the PCT curves can 
be detected, as during the activation cycles the hysteresis can decrease. 
The cause of the hysteresis is still under debate, and these results 
emphasize the complex nature of this effect [36]. If the hysteresis 
would be purely an elastic effect, the model would yield proper results, 
as material properties such as the Young’s modulus vary smoothly 
with composition and are in fact, thermodynamically modelable and 
therefore predictable [37].
With higher substitutional ratios the model does not reflect the 
decreasing hysteresis. It is astonishing that the highly substituted alloys 
yield hysteresis factors, that are more than a power of magnitude lower 
than of the low-hysteresis LaNi5 alloy [10].
Our model predicts the hysteresis based on two different thermo-
dynamical databases. This means, that besides the sublattice model 
and the parameter set, there is no physical connection between the 
two databases, which could also cause the random predictions. A more 
sophisticated model would include a hysteresis factor that is added to 
the reference Gibbs energy terms. Then, this term could be modeled 
and reflect changes due to temperature and composition. Furthermore, 
if the physical cause for the hysteresis effect can be found, thermody-
namic quantities, for example, the bulk modulus, can be calculated with
ab initio methods and integrated into a future model.
4.4. Modeling of the PCT curves slope
The results of the structural characterization of the as-cast and heat-
treated alloys are summarized in Table 4. The diffraction profiles show 
a single P6/mmm structure for all of the compounds, indicating no 
secondary phases formed. Even for the compounds with a 𝑥total slightly 
above 1, no other phase could be detected.

Alloy_2 (Ce0.65La0.35)(Ni3.8Al0.4Fe0.4Mn0.4), (e, f) Alloy_3 (Ce0.65La0.35)(Ni3.5Al0.5Fe0.5Mn0.5). Insets show the parts of XRD patterns representing the most intensive reflections. On 
the right, the CALPHAD data is generated from the assessed database and the experimentally measured microstrain parameter.
The higher the concentration of substituent elements is, the higher 
the microstrain is (which is mainly an artifact of the phase width). The 
annealed samples show a reduction in the microstrain, likely dominated 
by the homogenization of the alloy.
In Fig. 4 and Figure S6 in the SI the result of the X-ray diffraction 
and sorption experiments are shown. The results show good agreement 
with the calculated PCT curves. The simulated slope is slightly smaller 
than experimentally measured in the PCT curves. In XRD measurements 
on the stoichiometric compounds LaNi5 and CeNi5 the influence of the 
dislocations on the microstrain was quantified to 𝜖0,disl = 0.00006 −
0.00016. As this effect was neglected in our model the difference of 
simulation to experiment would increase accordingly to the measured 
𝜖0 values. This brings the conclusion, that other effects, such as kinetic 
limitations contribute to the sloping of the plateaus. The magnitude 
of this contribution can be approximated by the difference of the 
simulated and measured slopes in Fig. 4.
This result gives the opportunity, that with a single XRD measure-
ment, the full non-ideal PCT curve of a metal alloy can be reasonably

5. Conclusions
This work establishes a crucial foundation for the thermodynamic 
modeling of metal hydrides under para-equilibrium conditions, demon-
strating for the first time the successful integration of complex, multi-
component metal-hydride systems into a coherent computational frame-
work. The challenges associated with modeling the hydrogen sorption 
properties of metal hydrides, particularly under conditions of partial 
equilibrium, have been addressed through the development of a novel 
computational approach, introduced recently by the authors. The de-
veloped approach allows for the rapid assessment of many-component 
systems. In this paper, we validated the approach with precise predic-
tions of reaction enthalpies, plateau pressures, and sorption capacities 
in a six-component system.
The implementation of different databases for absorption and des-
orption showed for the first time the capabilities representing the 
hysteresis effect with the CALPHAD method. Furthermore, the direct 
calculation of sloped PCT curves from X-ray diffraction data is another 
step in facilitating the development process of new hydrogen storage 
alloys. This paper contributes to addressing the ongoing questions 
about the origin of these non-ideal sorption properties. This work lies 
a foundation to model hysteresis between absorption and desorption. 
Our investigation emphasizes the need to link the two datasets with a 
physical component. Within our CALPHAD workflow, the sloping PCT 
is well reconstructed by the measurement of the phase width.
The methodology presented in this paper is not an endpoint but the 
beginning of a much broader application. This framework can be fur-
ther expanded to other material systems, such as high-entropy-alloys, 
AB2, and AB-type metal hydrides. Another necessary step to keep this 
modeling technique competitive with the increasing demand for predic-
tive methods is to incorporate complementary computational tools. The 
usage of ab initio data can improve thermodynamic predictions where 
experimental data is scarce or difficult to obtain.
