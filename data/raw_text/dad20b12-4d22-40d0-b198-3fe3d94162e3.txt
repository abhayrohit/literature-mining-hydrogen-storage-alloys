Abstract 
Magnesium hydride (MgH2 ) has garnered signiﬁcant attention as a promising material for high-capacity hydrogen storage. However, 
its commercial application remains challenging due to the high operating temperature and slow reaction kinetics. In this study, melt-spun 
Ti45 Cr40 Nb15 (with a BCC phase) hydride (designated as TiCrNbHx−MS) was synthesized and used to form a nano-multiphase composite to 
improve the de-/rehydrogenation properties of MgH2 through ball milling. The incorporation of TiCrNbHx−MS was shown to signiﬁcantly 
enhance the hydrogen de-/rehydrogenation properties of MgH2 . The MgH2 + 20 wt% TiCrNbHx−MS composite exhibits an appealing initial 
dehydrogenation temperature of 163 °C and can absorb hydrogen at room temperature. Notably, it releases 5.8 wt% hydrogen in 700 s at 
230 °C and recharges 4.3 wt% hydrogen in just 2 mins at 150 °C. Even after 100 cycles, it retains a reversible hydrogen capacity of 4.98 
wt%. Kinetic analysis revealed that the dehydrogenation rate follows the Chou surface penetration model. Microstructural analysis showed 
that the FCC phase of the melt-spun TiCrNbHx−MS hydride reversibly transformed into the BCC phase during the de-/rehydrogenation 
process in the composite. Numerous phase interfaces were generated and uniformly dispersed on the MgH2 surface, providing additional 
hydrogen diffusion pathways and heterogeneous nucleation sites for Mg/MgH2 , thereby further improving the hydrogen de-/rehydrogenation 
kinetics of the system. This study offers valuable insights into the use of multiphase composites to enhance MgH2 performance.

transformation [ 1 , 2 ]. However, ﬁnding a low-cost, efﬁcient, 
reversible, and safe method for hydrogen storage remains 
critical to the advancement of the hydrogen economy [ 3 , 4 ]. 
Compared to storing hydrogen in its gaseous form, which 
requires signiﬁcant compression, or in liquid form, which ne- 
cessitates cooling to below −253 °C, solid-state hydrogen 
storage offers greater potential in terms of safety and en- 
ergy efﬁciency [ 5–7 ]. Early hydrogen storage materials, such 
as LaNi5 , TiMn2 , and TiFe, could readily and reversibly ab- 
sorb and release hydrogen under moderate conditions after 
full activation. However, their low hydrogen storage capac- 
ities (1.4–2.0 wt%) limit their practical application [ 8–10 ]. 
Magnesium hydride (MgH2 ), by contrast, has attracted more

attention due to its high hydrogen storage capacity (7.6 wt%), 
along with the abundance and low cost of magnesium [ 11 , 12 ]. 
Despite these advantages, the high operating temperature re- 
quired for dehydrogenation ( > 300 °C) and the slow hydro- 
gen de-/rehydrogenation rates have hindered its large-scale 
industrial use [ 13 , 14 ]. To overcome these challenges, a range 
of modiﬁcation strategies, such as alloying, catalyst doping, 
nanosizing, and compositing, have been widely explored to 
improve the thermodynamics and kinetics of hydrogen de- 
/rehydrogenation in Mg/MgH2 systems [ 15–20 ]. 
It is worth noting that catalytic doping has been proven 
to be one of the most practical and effective methods for 
enhancing the de-/rehydrogenation properties of MgH2 [ 21–
23 ]. Multivalent transition metals (TMs) and their compounds 
have been extensively studied for their ability to accelerate the 
breaking and recombination of Mg-H and H-H bonds. This 
enhancement is attributed to the unsaturated D -band electrons 
of TMs, which cause greater perturbation compared to Mg 
when interacting with the hydrogen antibonding orbitals [ 24 ]. 
Cui et al. [ 25 ] demonstrated closed correlation on the elec- 
tronegativities of TMs against the dehydrogenation of MgH2 , 
ranking from Ti, Nb, Ni, V, Co to Mo. Zhang et al. [ 26 ] em- 
ployed the synthesized multivalent NbHx , ball milled with 
MgH2 , and achieved 7 wt% of hydrogen dehydrogenation 
within 9 mins upon 3 kPa at 300 °C. Jangir et al. [ 27 ] adopted 
5 wt% TiH2 doped into MgH2 and the composites exhibited 
a much lower dehydrogenated activation energy (−77.56 kJ 
/mol) than the pristine MgH2 (−137.13 kJ /mol). Dan et al. 
[ 28 ] developed Nb-doped TiO2 for MgH2 , and achieved that 
6 wt% H2 releasing in 12 mins at 225 °C and 5 wt% H2 
absorbing for 20 s at room temperature when incorporated 8 
wt% Ti(30Nb)O2 to MgH2 . Liu et al. [ 29 ] synthesized a novel 
nanosized NiCoFeCuMg HEA@C catalysts modiﬁed MgH2 , 
and achieved an initial dehydrogenation temperature down to 
167.2 °C, accompanied by a stable 97 % reversible hydrogen 
capacity retention over 20 cycles. 
Additionally, intermetallic compounds of multivalent tran- 
sition metals (TMs), such as TiAl, Ti3 Al, TiV, TiNb, ZrMn2 , 
LaNi5 , and TiCrV, have gained signiﬁcant attention due 
to their synergistic catalytic effects [ 30–33 ]. A particularly 
favoured approach involves doping intrinsic hydrogen storage 
compounds like TiFe [ 34 ], LaNi5 [ 10 ], V-based solid solution 
[ 35 ] into the Mg/MgH2 system, capitalizing on the strengths 
of each component. This method not only harnesses syner- 
gistic catalytic effects but also maintains the system’s higher 
hydrogen storage capacity, avoiding the added weight associ- 
ated with conventional catalysts. 
For instance, Lu et al. [ 36 ] prepared a composite of MgH2 
doped with 10 wt% TiFe and 5 wt% CNTs, which released 
6.5 wt% hydrogen in 10 mins at 300 °C and reabsorbed 5.3 
wt% H2 at 125 °C under 3 MPa pressure. Liang et al. [ 37 ] 
demonstrated excellent low-temperature hydrogenation kinet- 
ics in Mg + 50 at% LaNi5 composites, prepared via me- 
chanical milling under an Ar atmosphere. The enhanced per- 
formance was attributed to numerous phase boundaries and 
porous surfaces formed during the de-/rehydrogenation pro- 
cess, particularly the phases Mg, LaHx , and Mg2 Ni. 
Moreover, V-based BCC-type hydrogen storage alloys, 
which offer a capacity of approximately 4.0 wt% H2 , have 
been widely introduced to modify MgH2 , signiﬁcantly im- 
proving both the de-/rehydrogenation properties and cyclic 
performance of Mg/MgH2 systems. For example, Yu et al. 
[ 38 ] showed that the hydride of TiCrVMn BCC alloys cat- 
alyzed MgH2 , releasing 5.7 wt% hydrogen in 30 mins at 
290 °C and reabsorbing over 90 % of the initial hydrogen ca- 
pacity within 100 mins at 100 °C. This improvement was at- 
tributed to the increased hydrogen diffusion channels provided 
by micro- and nanosized particles and defects in the nano 
or amorphous phases on the MgH2 surface. Similarly, Zhang 
et al. [ 39 ] utilized nanocrystalline Mg-20 wt% Ti0.16 Cr0.24 V0.6 
composites via reactive ball milling, achieving 5.67 wt% hy- 
drogen dehydrogenation in 20 mins at 270 °C and 0.01 MPa. 
However, V-based BCC type alloys are costly due to the 
high price and challenging smelting process of V raw mate- 
rials. To address this, recent developments have focused on 
low-V or V-free BCC-type alloys to reduce costs. Researchers 
have successfully substituted V with Fe or Mo, achieving rea- 
sonable hydrogen storage properties in these alloys [ 40 ]. Our 
group has also developed economical V-free BCC-type al- 
loys with a single BCC phase, using Nb or Mo as substitutes 
for V through rapid solidiﬁcation techniques such as water 
quenching, suction casting, and melt spinning [ 41 , 42 ]. Both 
Ti and Nb have demonstrated superior catalytic effects in re- 
ducing dehydrogenation temperatures and accelerating hydro- 
gen sorption kinetics in MgH2 . 
In this study, a self-synthesized hydride of melt-spun 
Ti45 Cr40 Nb15 BCC-type hydrogen storage alloy (abbrevi- 
ated as TiCrNbHx -MS) was designed and, for the ﬁrst 
time, employed as a catalyst to regulate the hydrogen de- 
/rehydrogenation performance of MgH2 . We systematically 
investigated the catalytic effects of TiCrNbHx -MS on the de- 
/rehydrogenation kinetics, thermodynamics, and cyclic sta- 
bility of MgH2 . The microstructure evolution and catalytic 
mechanisms were also explored, providing valuable insights 
for the potential commercial application of Mg-based multi- 
phase composite hydrogen storage materials. 
2. Experimental section 
2.1. Sample preparation 
The starting materials, including titanium (Ti, sponge, 
99.9 %), chromium (Cr, granules, 99.9 %), and niobium (Nb, 
Aladin, metal powders, 99.99 %), were commercially ob- 
tained and used without further puriﬁcation. The metals Ti 
and Cr were purchased from Zhongnuo Advanced Material 
(Beijing) Technology Co., Ltd. The Ti45 Cr40 Nb15 ingots and 
melt-spun samples (denoted as TiCrNb-AC and TiCrNb-MS, 
respectively) were synthesized as described in our previous 
work [ 39 ]. Brieﬂy, 10 g ingots of Ti45 Cr40 Nb15 were pro- 
duced using an arc melting process (WK Series Vacuum Arc 
Melter, Physcience, China) with a melting current of 100–
140 A, and were ﬂipped and remelted four times to ensure 
compositional homogeneity. The prepared as-cast alloys were

subsequently polished to achieve a clean surface and cut into 
smaller pieces. Approximately 5 g of these particles were 
loaded into a quartz tube to prepare ribbons using a single- 
roller melt-spinning device (VSD500, AutoVac, China) at a 
roller surface speed of 25 m/s under an argon atmosphere. 
The resulting melt-spun ribbons (2 g) were loaded into a re- 
actor and sealed for complete hydrogenation using a Sievert- 
type PCT apparatus (ZDHM-4, Zhejiang University, China) 
following activation at 400 °C. The ﬁnal product, melt-spun 
Ti45 Cr40 Nb15 hydride (labeled as TiCrNbHx -MS), was suc- 
cessfully synthesized. 
MgH2 was synthesized via high-temperature hydrogenation 
followed by mechanical ball milling. Speciﬁcally, magnesium 
powder (Sinopharm Group, 99.95 %) was hydrogenated in a 
stainless-steel reactor using the aforementioned Sieverts-type 
apparatus at 400 °C for 6 h under 50 bar of hydrogen pres- 
sure. The hydrogenated Mg powder was subsequently trans- 
ferred to a milling jar under 30 bar of hydrogen and subjected 
to ball milling at 500 r/m for 5 h, utilizing a ball-to-powder 
weight ratio of 40:1 in a planetary ball mill (QM-3SP2, Nan- 
jing, China). The process was repeated twice, resulting in the 
ﬁnal MgH2 product. TiCrNbHx -MS-modiﬁed MgH2 compos- 
ites, containing 20 wt% of the hydride, were prepared through 
mechanical ball milling at 500 r/m under 50 bar of hydrogen 
for 18 h with a ball-to-sample ratio of 120:1. The milling pro- 
cedure was set by alternating 12 mins of milling with 6 mins 
pause to avoid overheating. Every 6 h milling was ﬁnished, 
the jar will be taken back to the glove box for further scrap- 
ing powder. For comparison, stoichiometrically equivalent Ti 
(Aladdin, metal powders, 99.99 %) and Nb powders (Aladdin, 
99.99 %) were also ball-milled with MgH2 , with a ball-to- 
sample ratio of 120:1. All sample handling procedures were 
conducted in an argon-ﬁlled Etelux Lab2000 glove box. 
2.2. Sample characterization 
Phase identiﬁcation was conducted using X-ray diffraction 
(XRD, PANalytical X’Pert, Netherlands) with Cu K α radia- 
tion (40 kV, 40 mA). To prevent exposure to air and mois- 
ture during the XRD analysis, the samples were covered with 
polyimide ﬁlm. Morphological and microstructural analyses 
were performed using ﬁeld emission scanning electron mi- 
croscopy (SEM, JEOL JSM-IT800, Japan) and high-resolution 
transmission electron microscopy (TEM, FEI Talos-F200s, 
USA). Elemental distributions were characterized using an 
energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX, Max) attached 
to the TEM. Dehydrogenation onset and peak temperatures 
were measured using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC, 
Netzsch STA 449F5, Germany) at various heating rates (2, 5, 
8, 10 °C ·min−¹) under ﬂowing argon as the purge gas. 
2.3. Hydrogen storage measurements 
For non-isothermal temperature-programmed desorption 
(TPD) tests, samples were heated from room temperature 
to 400 °C at a rate of 2 °C ·min−¹ using a resistance fur- 
nace under vacuum. The dehydrogenated samples were then 
recharged at a rate of 1 °C ·min−¹ under an initial pres- 
sure of 50 bar H2 . Isothermal de-/rehydrogenation measure- 
ments were carried out using the aforementioned Sieverts-type 
apparatus. Speciﬁcally, isothermal hydrogen rehydrogenation 
was conducted under an initial pressure of 50 bar H2 , while 
isothermal hydrogen dehydrogenation was performed under 
a backpressure of 0.001 bar, with samples rapidly heated to 
the desired temperature and maintained throughout the entire 
process. 
Pressure-Concentration-Temperature (PCT) measurements 
were performed using a commercial Sieverts apparatus 
(HPSA-autoPro device, China), with approximately 150 mg 
of sample used for each test. Cycling hydrogen de- 
/rehydrogenation tests were also conducted using this device, 
with approximately 200 mg of sample subjected to dehydro- 
genation at a constant temperature of 300 °C under 3 bar H2 
and rehydrogenation under 50 bar H2 for reversible cycling 
evaluation. 
3. Results and discussion 
3.1. Structure and morphological characterizations 
Fig. 1 a displays the XRD patterns of TiCrNb alloys at 
various preparation stages. The TiCrNb-AC alloy is charac- 
terized by the presence of the primary NbCr2 (C15 Laves) 
phase and a Ti-rich body-centered cubic (BCC) phase. Af- 
ter melt spinning, the TiCrNb-MS sample exhibits the typical 
BCC phase. Upon full rehydrogenation after several activation 
cycles, the TiCrNbHx -MS is entirely converted into a hydride 
with a face-centered cubic (FCC) phase, which aligns well 
with previously reported ﬁndings [ 43–45 ]. Fig. 1 b presents 
the SEM image of the TiCrNb-MS alloy, revealing a sur- 
face morphology with uniform ﬁne equiaxed crystal grains in 
the melt-spun alloy. Fig. 1 c shows that the alloy morphology 
develops several microcracks on the surface upon full hydro- 
gen recharging. To further examine the microstructure and 
investigate the alloy’s composition, TEM analysis was per- 
formed on the fully rehydrogenated TiCrNbHx -MS alloy. The 
elemental mapping obtained from EDX ( Fig. 1 d) indicates 
that Ti, Cr, and Nb are homogeneously distributed throughout 
the hydride. Fig. 1 e-f depict high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) 
images of the TiCrNbHx -MS hydride, showing characteristic 
lattice spacings of 0.2263 nm and 0.2306 nm, which corre- 
spond to the (1 ¯1 1) and (1 ¯1 ¯1 ) planes of the FCC phase, re- 
spectively. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pat- 
tern ( Fig. 1 g) conﬁrms that the alloy exhibits a typical FCC 
phase with the [ ¯1 ¯1 0] zone axis. Additionally, the microcrys- 
talline structure of the TiCrNb-MS alloy was analyzed using 
TEM to verify the structural evolution during hydrogen de- 
/rehydrogenation (shown in Fig. S1a-d). Fig.S1a shows con- 
tinuous diffraction rings corresponding to the (110), (200), 
and (211) planes of the BCC phase in the TiCrNb-MS alloy. 
The lattice spacing of 0.2078 nm is attributed to the (110) 
plane of the BCC phase, as illustrated in Fig. S1c and d. The 
TEM results corroborate the XRD analysis, conﬁrming the

3.2. Hydrogen storage performance of TiCrNbHx−MS 
modiﬁed MgH2 
To assess the catalytic effects of the TiCrNbHx -MS- 
modiﬁed MgH2 system, non-isothermal and isothermal dehy- 
drogenation experiments were conducted on MgH2 + 20 wt% 
TiCrNbHx -MS, stoichiometric MgH2 -Ti and MgH2 -Nb (with 
equal amounts of Ti and Nb), and ball-milled MgH2 samples. 
Fig. 2 a displays the TPD volumetric hydrogen release curves 
of the modiﬁed MgH2 samples, conﬁrming that the catalysts 
effectively reduce the onset dehydrogenation temperature to 
varying degrees. The temperature at which the composite re-

temperature [ 46 ]. Pristine MgH2 began releasing hydrogen at 
approximately 286 °C and fully desorbed ∼7.44 wt% H2 . By 
adding 20 wt% TiCrNbHx -MS to MgH2 , the onset dehydro- 
genation temperature was signiﬁcantly reduced to ∼163 °C, 
with ∼6.6 wt% H2 fully desorbed—representing a reduction 
of 123 °C compared to pristine MgH2 . Even with the addi- 
tive amount increased to 20 wt%, the MgH2 + TiCrNbHx -MS 
composite retains a high total hydrogen storage capacity, at- 
tributed to the intrinsic hydrogen de-/rehydrogenation proper- 
ties of the melt-spun TiCrNb alloys with a single BCC phase. 
Furthermore, MgH2 catalyzed with Ti or Nb showed a similar 
onset temperature of ∼196 °C. 
Fig. 2 b-d present the isothermal dehydrogenated curves 
for MgH2 samples with the respective catalysts. As shown 
in Fig. 2 b, the MgH2 + 20 wt% TiCrNbHx -MS compos- 
ite desorbed approximately 6.34 wt% hydrogen within 230 s 
at 270 °C and around 5.80 wt% hydrogen within 700 s at 
230 °C. The isothermal dehydrogenation and rehydrogena- 
tion curves of pristine MgH2 at different temperatures are 
depicted in Fig. S2, showing that nearly no hydrogen release 
was detected from ball-milled MgH2 even at 250 °C. Un- 
der the same temperature, the dehydrogenation kinetics of 
the MgH2 + 20 wt% TiCrNbHx -MS composite was signiﬁ- 
cantly better compared to MgH2 catalyzed by either Ti or Nb 
alone, as illustrated in Figs. 2 c and d. Speciﬁcally, MgH2 cat- 
alyzed with stoichiometric amounts of Ti and Nb released ap- 
proximately 4.53 wt% and 4.80 wt% hydrogen, respectively, 
within 1000 s at 250 °C. At 200 °C (Fig. S3), MgH2 cat- 
alyzed with Ti and Nb each released 1.0 wt% hydrogen within 
3000 s, whereas TiCrNbHx -MS-catalyzed MgH2 desorbed ap- 
proximately 2.5 wt% under the same conditions. Clearly, the 
MgH2 + TiCrNbHx -MS composite exhibited the fastest de- 
hydrogenation rates among the tested samples. 
Fig. 2 e shows the hydrogen rehydrogenated kinetics curves 
of the TiCrNb-MS alloy from 25 °C to 150 °C, indicating a 
maximum hydrogen absorption of 2.83 wt% at 150 °C. Fur- 
thermore, with the addition of TiCrNbHx -MS, the composite 
could absorb hydrogen even at room temperature (25 °C). 
The isothermal rehydrogenation tests of the MgH2 + 20 wt% 
TiCrNbHx -MS composite at various temperatures ( Fig. 2 f) re- 
veal that it recharged 1.6 wt% hydrogen within 1 h at 50 °C. 
The rehydrogenation kinetics improved as the temperature in- 
creased, with the composite recharging 2.6 wt% hydrogen in 
10 mins and 3.2 wt% in 1 h at 100 °C, and absorbing 4.3 
wt% hydrogen within 2 mins at 150 °C. These results in- 
dicate that TiCrNbHx -MS-catalyzed MgH2 exhibits excellent 
rehydrogenation kinetics even at low temperatures. 
3.3. De-/rehydrogenation kinetics calculation by Chou model 
To understand the mechanism behind the enhanced dehy- 
drogenation kinetics, all isothermal dehydrogenation curves 
were analyzed using the Chou model [ 47 , 48 ]. According 
to the basically consensus about the hydrogen adsorption 
process, which can be described as following steps [ 49 ]: (a) 
surface physical/chemical hydrogen adsorption process; (b) 
surface hydrogen dissociation, penetration and diffusion pro- 
cess of H atoms in β-phase; (c) nucleation and growth process 
of β-phase; (d) interface chemical reaction process. Actually, 
the hydrogen diffusion coefﬁcient when passing through the

passivation layer is very small. Furthermore, the diffusion 
reaction becomes inactive due to the hydrogen diffusion 
difference crossing the different phase interfaces. The Chou 
model provides a physical interpretation of the generalized 
rate constant and offers a clear expression for calculation and 
theoretical analysis, which is used to analyze the hydrogen 
de-/absorption reaction by describing step (b). Speciﬁcally, the 
Chou model describes the functional relationship between the 
rate and factors such as temperature, pressure, particle size, 
and equilibrium pressure. It introduces the concept of “charac- 
teristic reaction time, tc ” and determines the activation energy 
Ea to assess the inﬂuence of temperature on the rate constant. 
In summary, when the rate-controlling step is diffusion, the 
equations can be represented as shown in Eq. (1) [ 50 ]:

where ξ is the reaction fraction, and t is the reaction time, 
respectively. When t = tc , ξ = 1, tc represents the time re- 
quired for the complete reaction, referred to as “characteristic 
reaction time.” A smaller tc indicates faster reaction rate. The 
calculated tc values and the predicted dehydrogenation kinetic 
curves using the Chou model for the respective samples are 
presented in Table S1 and Figs. 3 a-c, respectively. The ﬁtting 
results indicate that surface penetration is the rate-determining 
step for MgH2 modiﬁed with Ti, Nb, and TiCrNbHx -MS. The 
tc value of the MgH2 + 20 wt% TiCrNbHx -MS composite 
decreases with increasing temperature, from 815 s at 230 °C 
to 362 s at 270 °C, which is also the lowest among the three 
catalyst-modiﬁed MgH2 samples, even at 270 °C. To eval- 
uate the enhancement in dehydrogenation kinetics achieved 
by TiCrNbHx -MS catalysis, the apparent dehydrogenation 
activation energy Des- Ea can be calculated using Eq. (3) of 
the Chou penetration model [ 51 ]: 
ξ = 1 −

(3) 
Where Ea is the activation energy, T is the temperature, 
R is the gas constant, and Bt is the pressure coefﬁcient. 
Therefore, the Des- Ea can be calculated as 73.29 kJ ·mol−1 , 
and the calculated Des- Ea is much lower than that of the 
investigated Ti, Nb catalysts and the pristine MgH2 , which 
further clariﬁed the enhanced kinetics catalyzed by the 
TiCrNbHx -MS. It is worth noting that the dehydrogenation 
curves of Ti-, Nb catalyzed MgH2 (in Fig. 2 c, d) show an 
anti “S” type, which is considered as a typical feature of the 
nucleation and growth process [ 12 ]. 
To further verify the dehydrogenation activation energy 
Des- Ea , DSC measurements were conducted, and the corre- 
sponding DSC curves for the catalyst-modiﬁed and pristine 
MgH2 at different temperatures, using heating rates of 2, 5,

Where β is the heating rate, Tm is the peak temperature, 
and A is the temperature-independent constant. By ﬁtting the 
Kissinger plots derived from the relationship between β and 
Tm (shown in Fig. 4 c), the dehydrogenated activation en- 
ergy Des- Ea values were calculated to be 62.63 kJ ·mol−1 
for the TiCrNbHx -MS-catalyzed MgH2 composite and 120.54 
kJ ·mol−1 for ball-milled pristine MgH2 . Furthermore, the 
comparative Nb- and Ti- catalyzed MgH2 composites were 
also performed by DSC testing with the same condition. The 
results are shown in Fig. S4. The Des- Ea values of Nb- and 
Ti- catalyzed MgH2 were determined to be 110.82 and 91.66 
kJ ·mol−1 , respectively. It represents approximately a 50 % 
reduction in Des- Ea for TiCrNbHx -MS-catalyzed MgH2 com- 
pared to ball-milled MgH2 . Table 1 presents the initial dehy- 
drogenation temperature and the dehydrogenation activation 
energy of different additions catalyzed MgH2 systems. It is 
found from the table that the TiCrNbHx−MS has superior ad- 
vantages in achieving the lower Des- Ea and the onset dehy- 
drogenation temperature than that of the V-based BCC solid 
solution catalyzed MgH2 . Even its catalytic effect is better 
than the HEAs catalyst prepared by the chemical synthesis. 
It is demonstrated that the melt spun TiCrNb indeed has ex- 
cellent catalytic effect on tuning the comprehensive hydrogen 
storage performance of MgH2 . 
3.4. Thermodynamic behavior of TiCrNbHx -MS modiﬁed 
MgH2 
To further evaluate the thermodynamic performance of 
the samples, the dehydrogenation reaction enthalpy changes 
of the composite and ball-milled MgH2 were calculated 
using the van’t Hoff equation. Figs. 5 a-c show the de- 
/rehydrogenation PCT curves for MgH2 + TiCrNbHx -MS 
and pristine MgH2 . The dehydrogenated plateau pressures 
for MgH2 + TiCrNbHx -MS were determined to be 2.02, 
2.91, 5.19, and 8.58 bar at 310, 330, 350, and 370 °C, re- 
spectively, while those for ball-milled MgH2 were measured 
as 2.42, 4.16, 7.33, and 11.38 bar at 315, 335, 355, and 
375 °C, respectively. The corresponding dehydrogenation en- 
thalpy changes ( H ) were also calculated and are shown in 
Fig. 5 c. Notably, the calculated H value for TiCrNbHx -MS- 
modiﬁed MgH2 was 75.5 kJ ·mol−1 H2 , which was slightly

lower than that of pristine MgH2 (78.1 kJ ·mol−1 H2 ). Thus, 
it indicates that incorporating TiCrNbHx -MS has minimal ef- 
fect on the thermodynamic properties of MgH2 . 
3.5. Cycling performance of TiCrNbHx -MS modiﬁed MgH2 
Reversible cycling stability is a critical parameter for the 
practical application of magnesium-based hydrogen storage 
systems [ 55 , 56 ]. To further evaluate the cycling stability of 
the MgH2 + 20 wt% TiCrNbHx -MS composite, hydrogen de- 
/rehydrogenation cycling tests were conducted at 300 °C. As 
shown in Fig. 6 a, the reversible hydrogen capacity decreased 
from 6.18 wt% to 5.03 wt% after 10 cycles. This is often at- 
tributed to an “activation process” that occurs during the ini- 
tial de-/rehydrogenation cycles, as reported in previous studies 
[ 19 , 57 , 58 ]. The detailed data proﬁles (Fig. S5) for the 1st, 30 
th, 50 th, and 100 th cycle indicate that it took about 5 mins 
for the composite to release its full hydrogen content dur- 
ing the ﬁrst dehydrogenation, while subsequent cycles only 
took approximately 3 mins. The composite exhibited a rapid 
hydrogen uptake and release rate over 100 cycles, with a ca- 
pacity degradation from 6.18 wt% to 4.98 wt%. This corre- 
sponds to a hydrogen capacity retention of 81 %, as shown 
in Fig. 6 c. The results demonstrate that the rapid decline in 
hydrogen capacity occurred during the initial few cycles in 
the MgH2 + 20 wt% TiCrNbHx -MS system, after which the 
dehydrogenation capacity remained stable in the following cy- 
cles. The XRD patterns results (shown in Fig. S6) reveal that 
there is no new phase generated after cycling. In order to fur- 
ther explore the effect of cycling on kinetic performance, the 
de-/rehydrogenation data were computationally analyzed by 
kinetic model. According to the previous analysis, it implies 
that the rate-controlling step of hydrogen de-/rehydrogenation 
process of the MgH2 + 20 wt% TiCrNbHx -MS composite 
was the surface penetration. Actually, Mg can instantaneously 
nucleate on the particle surface and it is feasible for metal 
atoms to achieve the long-range diffusion and the diffusion 
of H atoms into the hydride layer under high temperature. 
The nucleation and growth of Mg and H diffusion during 
dehydrogenation can be rapidly ﬁnished. The tc values calcu- 
lated by the Chou-penetration model were analyzed to evalu- 
ate the variation of the dehydrogenated kinetic property dur- 
ing the cycle, as presented in Fig. 6 b. The tc values rapidly 
decrease at the beginning and then slightly increase with cy- 
cling numbers ascending. The kinetic performance from 40 
to 100 cycles is relatively stable. As reported, the phase tran- 
sition between Mg-MgH2 will occur 32 % volume expansion 
or contraction [ 12 ]. However, the powder agglomeration will 
inevitably exist under long-term high temperature. This phe- 
nomenon will make hydrogen penetration more difﬁcult dur- 
ing few initial cycles. After that, particle cracking happens 
and smaller particles and larger speciﬁc surface area can be 
achieved. It is beneﬁcial to hydrogen penetration ascribed that 
there are more active sites and providing more penetration 
driving energy. 
3.6. Microstructure evolution and mechanism analysis of 
TiCrNbHx -MS modiﬁed MgH2 
The TiCrNbHx -MS catalyst exhibited a remarkable cat- 
alytic effect on the hydrogen storage behavior of MgH2 , 
as demonstrated in the above analysis. To further under- 
stand the role of TiCrNbHx -MS in enhancing the hydrogen 
storage properties of MgH2 , the microstructural evolution 
of ball-milled TiCrNbHx -MS-modiﬁed MgH2 during the 
de-/rehydrogenation process was investigated using X-ray 
diffraction (XRD). Fig. 7 a shows the XRD patterns of the 
ball-milled, rehydrogenated, and dehydrogenated states of the 
TiCrNbHx -MS-modiﬁed MgH2 composite. From the XRD 
patterns of the ball-milled state, the main diffraction peaks 
are identiﬁed as belonging to the MgH2 phase (P42/mnm, 
JCPDS: 12–0697). Additionally, a diffraction peak at 41.6 °
corresponds to the TiCrNbHx -MS hydride, while peaks 
at 43.1 ° and 45.2 ° correspond to the NbCr2 phase. This 
indicates that no reaction occurred between MgH2 and the 
catalyst, as no new phases were detected after ball milling. 
When the composite was ball-milled under 50 bar hy- 
drogen pressure, the TiCrNbHx -MS hydride was clearly 
detected. In the XRD pattern of the dehydrogenated state, the 
predominant phase was α-Mg (P63/mmc, JCPDS: 65–3365), 
along with some diffraction peaks belonging to the BCC and 
FCC phases of the melt-spun TiCrNb alloy [ 59 ]. After full

rehydrogenation, the composite consisted mainly of MgH2 , 
the FCC phase of the melt-spun TiCrNb alloy, and a minor 
Mg phase. Furthermore, Fig. 7 b shows the XRD patterns of 
the composite under different dehydrogenation temperatures. 
The XRD results indicate that the MgH2 phase was detected 
after dehydrogenation at 200 °C and disappeared when the 
process was carried out at 250 °C. At higher temperatures, 
the hydrogenated TiCrNbHx -MS transformed into the BCC 
structure of the TiCrNb-MS alloy during ball milling with 
MgH2 in the dehydrogenation process. 
To further reveal the microstructural features of this sys- 
tem, TEM analysis was conducted on MgH2 + TiCrNbHx -MS 
in different states. As shown in Fig. 8 a, the measured inter- 
planar spacing d value of 0.249 nm corresponds to the (101) 
lattice plane of the MgH2 phase in the ball-milled state. The 
measured d values of 0.216 nm and 0.211 nm match the (200) 
plane of the FCC phase of the TiCrNbHx -MS alloy. Addition- 
ally, elemental mapping results ( Fig. 8 b) show that Ti, Cr, and 
Nb from the TiCrNb nanoparticles are uniformly distributed 
in the MgH2 matrix. After dehydrogenation, the characteristic 
spacing values of 0.273 nm and 0.276 nm were assigned to 
the (100) lattice plane of the α-Mg phase (P63/mmc, JCPDS: 
65–3365), as depicted in Fig. 8 c. The measured spacing val- 
ues of 0.210 nm and 0.208 nm were attributed to the (110) 
lattice plane of the BCC phase of the TiCrNb-MS alloy. It is 
evident that the dehydrogenated composite consists of nano- 
sized dark-gray TiCrNb phase spots embedded in the MgH2 
matrix. The HRTEM image of the sample after rehydrogena- 
tion is presented in Fig. 8 e, showing a spacing of 0.219 nm 
and 0.231 nm, corresponding to the (200) lattice plane of 
the MgH2 phase and the (200) lattice plane of the FCC 
phase of the TiCrNbHx -MS alloy, respectively. As depicted in

Fig. 9. Schematic summary of catalytic mechanism of the TiCrNbHx -MS modiﬁed MgH2 . 
Fig. 8 f, the distribution of the elements Ti, Cr, and Nb indi- 
cates that the nanosized TiCrNb phase is uniformly embedded 
in the MgH2 matrix. 
Based on the aforementioned hydrogen storage properties 
and microstructural analysis, the de-/rehydrogenation mecha- 
nism of the MgH2 + TiCrNbHx -MS composite is illustrated 
in Fig. 9 . The uniformly dispersed TiCrNbHx -MS particles 
act as “hydrogen pumps,” accelerating hydrogen absorption 
and dissociation due to their superior kinetics. Certainly, the 
electronegativity of Ti (1.54) or Nb (1.6), being between that 
of H (2.2) and Mg (1.31), which has been veriﬁed to in- 
deed weaken the Mg-H bond energy [ 60–62 ]. Additionally, 
the melt-spun TiCrNbHx -MS alloy contains signiﬁcant lattice 
distortion and defects, further facilitating hydrogen diffusion 
into the Mg lattice via the interfaces. During dehydrogena- 
tion, Mg-H bonds at the MgH2 /TiCrNb interfaces are prefer- 
entially weakened due to additional interface energy, which 
subsequently induces lattice distortion in Mg, promoting hy- 
drogen release. 
Moreover, the fully hydrogenated TiCrNb alloy with the 
FCC phase transforms into the BCC phase when the compos- 
ite undergoes dehydrogenation at elevated temperatures. This 
phase transformation provides numerous hydrogen diffusion 
channels and active nucleation sites for Mg/MgH2 . During re- 
hydrogenation, hydrogen ﬁrst diffuses into the TiCrNb alloy 
and then migrates into the Mg matrix along the Mg/TiCrNb 
interfaces, ultimately forming the MgH2 phase. The BCC 
phase then reversibly transforms back to the FCC phase 
of the TiCrNb alloy upon rehydrogenation. Therefore, the 
TiCrNbHx -MS alloy actively catalyzes hydrogen combination 
and dissociation, enhancing the overall de-/rehydrogenation 
performance of MgH2 . 
4. Conclusion 
In this study, the Ti45 Cr40 Nb15 alloy was synthesized via 
melt spinning and then fully hydrogenated. The catalytic ef- 
fect of adding 20 wt% Ti45 Cr40 Nb15 Hx -MS to MgH2 through 
ball milling was investigated to enhance the hydrogen storage 
performance of MgH2 . The TiCrNbHx -MS-catalyzed MgH2 
composite exhibited an impressive initial dehydrogenation 
temperature of 163 °C, and the dehydrogenated state was able 
to readily absorb hydrogen at room temperature. According to 
the Chou model, the rate-controlling step of dehydrogenation 
was determined to be surface penetration, and the dehydro- 
genation activation energy Ea was reduced to 73.29 kJ ·mol−1 . 
Furthermore, the composite demonstrated a reversible hydro- 
gen capacity retention of 81 % over 100 cycles at 300 °C. 
Microstructural analyses using XRD and TEM revealed 
that the FCC phase of the melt-spun TiCrNbHx -MS hydride, 
when ball-milled, reversibly transformed into the BCC phase 
during the de-/rehydrogenation process. This phase transfor- 
mation generated additional interfaces dispersed on the MgH2 
surface, providing more hydrogen diffusion channels and nu- 
cleation sites for Mg/MgH2 , thereby enhancing the hydrogen 
de-/rehydrogenation kinetics of the system. This work serves
