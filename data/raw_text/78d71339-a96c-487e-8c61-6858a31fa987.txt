Reversible solid-state hydrogen storage of magnesium hydride, traditionally
driven by external heating, is constrained by massive energy input and low
systematic energy density. Herein, a single phase of Mg2Ni(Cu) alloy is
designed via atomic reconstruction to achieve the ideal integration of pho-
tothermal and catalytic effects for stable solar-driven hydrogen storage of
MgH2. With the intra/inter-band transitions of Mg2Ni(Cu) and its hydrogenated
state, over 85% absorption in the entire spectrum is achieved, resulting in the
temperature up to 261.8 °C under 2.6 W cm−2. Moreover, the hydrogen storage
reaction of Mg2Ni(Cu) is thermodynamically and kinetically favored, and the
imbalanced distribution of the light-induced hot electrons within CuNi and
Mg2Ni(Cu) facilitates the weakening of Mg-H bonds of MgH2, enhancing the
“hydrogen pump” effect of Mg2Ni(Cu)/Mg2Ni(Cu)H4. The reversible genera-
tion of Mg2Ni(Cu) upon repeated dehydrogenation process enables the con-
tinuous integration of photothermal and catalytic roles stably, ensuring the
direct action of localized heat on the catalytic sites without any heat loss,
thereby achieving a 6.1 wt.% H2 reversible capacity with 95% retention under
3.5 W cm−2.
Hydrogen is a potential clean energy carrier for developing a carbon-
neutral system and of great signiﬁcance for realizing a global transition
to a sustainable energy economy. Unfortunately, the absence of a safe
and efﬁcient hydrogen storage method remains a major bottleneck for
the extensive utilization of hydrogen energy1–4. In comparison with
hydrogen storage in pressurized tanks or cryogenic containers, the
reversible storage of hydrogen into solid-state light-weight metal
hydrides holds the intrinsic advantages of high safety, low-cost, and
exceptional hydrogen storage capacity5–8. Among them, magnesium
hydride (MgH2) that has a gravimetric and volumetric hydrogen den-
sity of 7.6 wt.% and 110 kg m−3, respectively, and excellent reversibility,
is particularly favored9–12. Large energy input, however, is required to
drive hydrogen storage reaction of metal hydrides due to their high
thermodynamic stability and activation energy13–15. Particularly, a the-
oretical operating temperature of ~280 °C should be supplied to rea-
lize reversible hydrogen storage of MgH2 and the extra high kinetic
barrier would lead to even higher operating temperature of 400 °C16,17.
As a result, the reversible hydrogen storage of MgH2 mainly relies on
external energy input by intricate electric heating apparatus that
would unavoidably not only decrease the hydrogen storage capacity of
the whole system but also induce high energy consumption and costs
for their practical large-scale applications.
In order to solve this critical issue, we have recently proposed the
concept of solar-driven reversible hydrogen storage of metal hydrides

by using solar energy as the sustainable and unlimited energy
source18,19. It is realized by coupling the photothermal effect of light
adsorber (i.e., MXene and Cu) that could generate heat for elevating
the temperature of MgH2 and catalytic effect of thermochemical cat-
alysts (i.e., Ti/TiHx) that could decrease the operating temperature of
MgH2 by reducing kinetic barriers. Undoubtedly, the match of the
photothermal effect and the catalytic effect is a prerequisite for rea-
lizing solar-driven reversible hydrogen storage of MgH2. The light
adsorber and thermal catalysts are physically separated and the phase
separation of thermochemical catalysts, light adsorber, and MgH2,
however, inevitably leads to the delay of the transfer of thus-generated
heat from photothermal materials towards catalytic sites and the loss
of heat, which results in poor catalytic activity and light-to-heat con-
version efﬁciency. Moreover, both the photothermal effect of MXene
and Cu and the catalytic effect of Ti/TiHx is limited and hence an
extremely high light intensity of 4.0 W cm−2 is required for driving
reversible hydrogen storage reaction of MgH2.
Theoretically, it is an ideal solution to enhance solar-driven
hydrogen storage performance of MgH2 by introducing a single-
component phase that simultaneously holds photothermal and cat-
alytic effects. Herein, an in situ alloying reaction between MgH2 and
CuNi is developed to achieve the integration of the photothermal
effect with full-spectrum light absorption and the catalytic effect that
could signiﬁcantly lower the apparent activation energy of hydrogen
storage reaction. Under UV–vis irradiation, the strong localized sur-
face plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect of CuNi alloys would generate
localized heat at the catalytic sites of CuNi alloys, leading to superior
initial H2 desorption performance than that driven by traditional
heating. Together with the initial dehydrogenation process, the
in situ alloying reaction between Mg and CuNi results in simulta-
neous atomic reconstruction, leading to the formation of Mg2Ni(Cu)
ternary alloy that has the metallic properties and the combined effect
of intra/inter-band transitions. Therefore, an over 85% absorption in
the entire spectrum could be achieved for MgH2 catalyzed by CuNi
after the initial dehydrogenation process, which, due to the pro-
moted light-to-heat conversion efﬁciency, results in a high surface
temperature of 261.8 °C under 2.6 W cm−2, 15 °C higher than that
before cycling under identical condition. On the other hand, in
comparison with MgH2, the hydrogen storage reaction of Mg2Ni(Cu)
is thermodynamically and kinetically favored resulting from the
weakening of Mg–H bonds and the low migration barrier of hydrogen
atoms in both Mg2Ni(Cu) and Mg2Ni(Cu)H4, which in turn provides a
facile pathway for the spontaneous breaking of Mg–H bonds of
MgH2. More importantly, attributed to the smaller work function of
Cu than that of Ni and the larger work function of Cu than that of Mg,
the hot electrons generated by the LSPR effect of Cu could be
transferred to Ni inside of both CuNi and Mg2Ni(Cu) alloys, leading to
an increase in electron density around Ni during light irradiation. The
uneven distribution of light-induced hot electrons within CuNi and
Mg2Ni(Cu) alloy contributes to the effective weakening of Mg–H
bonds of MgH2 and hence enhances the “hydrogen pump” effect of
Mg2Ni(Cu)/Mg2Ni(Cu)H4, which improves cycling hydrogenation and
dehydrogenation of MgH2 and signiﬁcantly reduces the apparent
activation energy required for driving hydrogen storage in MgH2. As
a result, the in situ atomic reconstruction of Mg2Ni(Cu) enables the
integration
of
photothermal
and
catalytic
roles
in
a
single-
component phase, which allows the direct action of localized pho-
tothermal heat on the catalytic sites without any heat loss, resulting
in the complete dehydrogenation of MgH2 with a reversible capacity
of 6.1 wt.% within 15 min under 3.5 W cm−2. More importantly, the
stable reversible generation of Mg2Ni(Cu) during cycling hydrogen
storage process results in well-preserved photothermal and catalytic
effects in improving repeated hydrogenation and dehydrogenation
of MgH2, delivering a reversible H2 storage capacity of 6.1 wt.% with a
capacity retention of 95% after ten cycles using solar energy.
Results
Preparation and characterization of CuNi alloys
CuNi bimetallic alloys are ﬁrst synthesized via a one-step solvothermal
calcination method as shown in Supplementary Fig. 1. Nitrate salts
containing Cu and Ni ions are added and evenly dispersed in a mixed
aqueous solution of glycerol and propanediol, which is then hydro-
thermally treated at 150 °C for 3 h. After washing and thermal reduc-
tion, CuNi alloys encapsulated in carbon layers could be obtained. By
changing the appropriate amount of the precursors, the ratio of Cu
and Ni atoms in the thus-obtained alloy could be facile controlled,
resulting in the synthesis of Cu1Nix (Cu: Ni atomic ratio of 1:x), Cu, and
Ni, respectively. Inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spec-
troscopy (ICP-OES) indicates that the atomic ratios of Cu1Ni1, Cu1Ni2,
and Cu1Ni3 are 1:1.03, 1:2.01, and 1:3.01 (Supplementary Table 1),
respectively, which demonstrates the successful synthesis of CuNi
alloys with controllable atomic ratios by facile adjusting the ratio of
precursors.
According to X-ray diffraction (XRD) results (Fig. 1a), all the as-
synthesized catalysts exhibit three distinct diffraction peaks, indicat-
ing the formation of typical face-centered-cubic (FCC) crystal phase
with (111), (200), and (220) planes. The diffraction peaks of CuNi alloys
show no splitting and only slight shifts in the region between the dif-
fraction peaks of Cu (PDF#00-004-0836) and Ni (PDF#04-003-6597)
could be observed for CuNi alloys, which is attributed to the slight
change of crystal plane spacing caused by various Cu/Ni molar ratio20.
Among them, the diffraction peaks of Cu1Ni1 are located at 43.86°,
51.09°, and 75.17°, respectively, matching the standard diffraction
peaks of Cu0.5Ni0.5 (PDF#04-002-1345) ideally, thereby conﬁrming the
successful synthesis of Cu1Ni1 alloys. Moreover, the presence of Cu and
Ni in CuNi alloys is conﬁrmed in X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) survey spectra (Supplementary Fig. 2a). High-resolution Cu 2p
and Ni 2p XPS spectra (Fig. 1b, c and Supplementary Fig. 2c, d)
demonstrate that Cu and Ni are present mainly in their zero-valent
state, consistent with the XRD results. Particularly, the binding ener-
gies of Cu0 and Ni0 in CuNi alloys exhibit shifts compared to pure Cu
and Ni due to the electronegativity difference, indicating the electronic
interactions inside of CuNi alloys21,22. The weak peaks of Cu2+ and Ni2+
could be attributed to the slight oxidation of CuNi alloys during
measurement (Supplementary Table 2) and no chemical interaction
between the outer carbon layer and CuNi alloys could be observed in
the high-resolution C 1 s XPS spectra (Supplementary Fig. 2b).
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image (Fig. 1d) illustrates
that Cu1Ni1 is composed of densely packed spherical particles with an
average particle size of approximately 20 nm (Fig. 1g). High-resolution
transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images (Fig. 1e and Sup-
plementary Fig. 3a–d) conﬁrm that Cu1Ni1 alloys are wrapped by a
carbon layer of 3 nm with a weight percent of approximately 9% as
evidenced by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (Supplementary
Fig. 5a). The lattice spacing inside of Cu1Ni1 is calculated to be
0.206 nm, corresponding to the (111) crystal plane of Cu1Ni1. The
selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern in Fig. 1f conﬁrms
the polycrystal structure of Cu1Ni1 alloys and the diffraction rings
could be well recorded to (111), (200), and (220) crystal planes. In
addition, the lattice spacing measured from HRTEM images (Supple-
mentary Fig. 4a–d) presents a lattice spacing (0.206 nm) of Cu1Ni1 (111)
that is between the lattice spacing (0.210 nm) of Cu (111) and the lattice
spacing (0.203 nm) of Ni (111) with a periodic pattern, implying the
successful synthesis of Cu1Ni1 alloys wrapped with ultrathin carbon
layers. Furthermore, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) ele-
mental mapping and line scanning of two adjacent particles (Fig. 1h–j
and Supplementary Fig. 3e–j) results conﬁrm the homogeneous dis-
tribution of Cu and Ni, which coincides well with the morphology of
particles, further validating the uniform synthesis of CuNi alloys. In
addition, the morphology, particle size (Supplementary Fig. 6a–f), and
carbon content (Supplementary Fig. 5b, c) of Cu1Ni2, Cu1Ni3, and Ni are

similar to those of Cu1Ni1, while the particle size of Cu is approximately
50 nm (Supplementary Fig. 6g, h).
Solar-driven hydrogen storage performance of MgH2
The hydrogen storage performance using conventional electrical
heating method demonstrates that, in comparison to MgH2 catalyzed
by Ni nanoparticles, MgH2 under the catalysis of CuNi alloys exhibits
superior hydrogen storage performance of further decreased operat-
ing temperature with lower kinetic barriers and enhanced kinetics of
H2 desorption and absorption. The speciﬁc experimental results with
detailed analysis could be found in the Supplementary Information
(Supplementary Figs. 7–10). Attributed to the decrease of H2 deso-
rption activation energy to 80 kJ mol−1, the peak temperature of H2
desorption from MgH2 catalyzed by CuNi is reduced down to
approximately 245 °C, and complete H2 desorption could be achieved
within 30 min at 250 °C. Moreover, under a hydrogen pressure of
1 MPa at 250 °C, 6.1 wt.% H2 could be recharged within 10 min, and 95%
reversible capacity is maintained after ten cycles of H2 absorption and
desorption. Although the activation energy of heat-driven reversible
H2 storage of MgH2 catalyzed by CuNi has been lowered tremendously,
it still requires external thermal energy input towards realizing the
operating temperature of over 200 °C. Therefore, attempting to use
inexhaustible solar energy to drive H2 absorption and desorption of
CuNi-catalyzed MgH2 is a highly promising and environmentally-
friendly alternative. To investigate the solar-driven H2 storage perfor-
mance of MgH2, solar energy serves as the only energy input source
without external heating, which aligns with our goal of completely
replacing the electric heating with solar energy, via the apparatus
shown in Supplementary Fig. 11.
After the ball-milling process of MgH2 with the addition of cata-
lysts with a weight percent of 10%, an obvious color difference could be
observed (Fig. 2a). Pure MgH2 is essentially white and it turns into
yellowish-brown, and becomes darker and ﬁnally dark-black after the
addition of Ni, CuNi alloys with the increasing Cu content, and Cu,
respectively, indicating the increase of light absorption potential. It
could be directly supported by the ultraviolet–visible–near-infrared
(UV–vis–NIR) absorption spectra (Fig. 2b), which demonstrates that
MgH2 catalyzed by Cu has the highest overall absorbance capability
and the absorbance of MgH2 after the addition of CuNi alloys increases
as the relative Cu content in these catalysts increases, where Cu1Ni2

falls between those of Cu1Ni3 and Cu1Ni1. Notably, MgH2 under the
catalysis of Cu exhibits a characteristic absorption peak from 400 to
800 nm due to the LSPR effect of Cu nanoparticles (Supplementary
Fig. 12a)23. By comparison, a slight red-shift of the LSPR characteristic
peak of Cu is observed for MgH2 catalyzed by Cu1Ni1 owing to the size
changes of nanocrystals24. The FDTD simulations further demonstrate
that plasmonic “hot spot” regions could be clearly observed around
particles in both Cu and CuNi alloys, which validates the strong LSPR-
induced localized electric ﬁeld of Cu and CuNi (Supplementary
Fig. 12e–g). In addition, the relatively weaker absorption observed in
the NIR region also increases with higher Cu content, which could be
attributed to the scattering effect induced by the LSPR coupling of Cu
particles (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. 12b)25–27.
Herein, with the consideration of maximizing the differences
brought by photothermal effects under similar catalytic performance,
Cu1Ni1 and Cu1Ni3 are selected as representatives in the following.
Correspondingly, under the same intensity (2.5 W cm−2 and 3.0 W cm−2)
of solar irradiation, the surface temperature of MgH2 also increases
with the addition of catalysts that has more relative content of Cu
(Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. 12a). These results validate that, due to
the strong LSPR effect of metal nanoparticles of Cu and Ni, the intro-
duction of CuNi alloys endows MgH2 with overall stronger light
absorption and hence better photothermal effect under solar
irradiation.
As expected, induced by this photothermal effect, the surface
temperature of MgH2 catalyzed by Cu1Ni1 reaches 230.1 °C within
10 min under a solar irradiation intensity of 2.5 W cm−2, which could
drive the H2 desorption of MgH2 catalyzed by Cu1Ni1 (Fig. 2c),
achieving a rapid H2 desorption of 4.9 wt.% within 30 min (Fig. 2d). In
comparison to Cu1Ni1 alloys, MgH2 catalyzed by Cu1Ni3 exhibits the
same signiﬁcant decrease in dehydrogenation temperature and faster
kinetics in traditional heat-driven experiments compared to MgH2
catalyzed by Cu1Ni1 (Fig. 2e and Supplementary Fig. 7a). However,
under 2.5 W cm−2 illumination, MgH2 catalyzed by Cu1Ni3 only reaches
a surface temperature of 224.8 °C, corresponding to a H2 desorption
capacity of 4.6 wt.%, which is even 0.3 wt.% lower than that of MgH2
catalyzed by Cu1Ni1 (Fig. 2d). In addition, the difference of the dehy-
drogenation kinetics of MgH2 catalyzed by Cu1Ni1 and Cu1Ni3 becomes

almost negligible under the solar irradiation of 2.5 W cm−2 and
3.0 W cm−2 (Fig. 2d and Supplementary Fig. 13b). This result suggests
that the higher content of Cu in CuNi alloys, which brings about a
stronger photothermal effect, leads to further improvement of H2
desorption performance under solar irradiation compared to those
driven by direct heating, which provides direct evidence to the crucial
role of photothermal effect in enhancing solar-driven hydrogen sto-
rage of MgH2.
Upon the elevation of the irradiation intensity, the surface tem-
perature of MgH2 catalyzed by Cu1Ni1 would increase, which is capable
of promoting the degree and rate of H2 desorption from MgH2 (Fig. 2f
and Supplementary Fig. 14a, b). The dehydrogenation instantaneous
rate peaks within the initial 100 seconds under solar irradiation, and
the relationship between initial H2 release rates and light intensities is
exponential (Supplementary Fig. 14c, d), consistent with the Arrhenius
empirical equation28,29, which suggests that the photothermal effect
primarily operates as a plasma heating. Comparing the amount of H2
desorption at various temperatures and light intensities (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 14e), the H2 desorption performance under solar energy is
similar to that driven by thermal heating, that is, H2 release from MgH2
through a photothermal pathway induced by the light-to-heat con-
version ability of CuNi alloys rather than photocatalytic principle30. In
addition, the apparent activation energy under solar irradiation ﬁtted
by the Johnson–Mehl–Avrami (JMA) equation joint with the Arrhenius
equation is calculated to be 81.23 ± 3.35 kJ mol−1, which is comparable
to that driven by thermal heating (i.e., 81.56 ± 2.00 kJ mol−1) (Supple-
mentary Figs. 14f and 15h). These results validate that the solar-driven
dehydrogenation of MgH2 is mainly achieved based on the localized
heat produced by photothermal effect of CuNi alloys with the com-
bination of its catalytic effect.
To further highlight the advantages of solar-driven dehy-
drogenation over heat-driven dehydrogenation, the normalized H2
desorption capacities at various light intensities (or corresponding
surface temperatures) are calculated to intuitively demonstrate the
differences in H2 desorption ratio over time. MgH2 catalyzed by Cu1Ni1
could release 60% of H2 within 10 min under 2.5 W cm−2 irradiation
(Fig. 2g), while only 20% of H2 is released from MgH2 in 10 min under
electrical heating. Particularly, the superiority of fast response and
rate of H2 desorption under solar irradiation over direct heating
could
be
consistently
observed
for
MgH2
in
the
range
of
2.5 W cm−2 to 3.0 W cm−2 (Fig. 2g and Supplementary Fig. 15g). In
strong contrast, H2 desorption kinetics of MgH2 using direct heating
strongly depends on adopted temperatures induced by the low
thermal conductivity of MgH2 (<1 W m−1 K−1)31. The advantages of solar-
driven dehydrogenation over heat-driven H2 desorption in realizing
fast dehydrogenation are also measured and evaluated using the glass

contact-type
thermocouple
method
(Supplementary
Figs. 11c, d and 15a–f), and demonstrated in MgH2 catalyzed by Cu1Ni3,
Ni, and Cu, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 16a–f).
Speciﬁcally, when the light intensity is increased to 3.0 W cm−2, the
surface temperature of MgH2 catalyzed by Cu1Ni1 and Cu1Ni3 could
reach 251.6 °C and 248.9 °C, respectively, delivering a H2 desorption
capacity of 6.3 wt.% and 6.1 wt.% H2, respectively, corresponding to
almost
complete
dehydrogenation
of
MgH2
(Supplementary
Fig. 13a, b). In contrast, no H2 desorption could be observed from the
ball-milled MgH2 without CuNi alloys under the identical condition,
which directly demonstrates the vital role of CuNi alloys that act
simultaneously as light adsorber and thermochemical catalysts in
enabling solar-driven H2 desorption from MgH2. By comparison,
although the addition of Cu to MgH2 could obtain a higher surface
temperature of up to 260 °C under 3.0 W cm−2 light intensity induced
by the strong photothermal effect of Cu nanoparticles, only a capacity
of 4.6 wt.% could be achieved at 3.0 W cm−2 due to the negligible cat-
alytic effect of Cu in enhancing H2 desorption performance of MgH2
(Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. 7). Nonetheless, it is noteworthy that
the H2 desorption capacity of MgH2 catalyzed by Cu at 3.0 W cm−2 is
signiﬁcantly higher than the 0.7 wt.% H2 capacity under the heat-driven
temperature of 260 °C (Supplementary Fig. 16e). This result further
highlights the signiﬁcant role of LSPR effect of metal nanoparticles in
producing intense localized heat for driving H2 desorption of MgH2
under solar illumination. CuNi alloys, evenly distributed on the MgH2
matrix, could generate localized heat under solar irradiation that could
directly act on the catalytic center that is itself while the poor thermal
conductivity of “MgH2” could reduce the temperature gradient near
CuNi alloys, which is capable of promoting rapid H2 desorption from
MgH2
18. Therefore, MgH2 catalyzed by Cu1Ni1 releases 5.3 wt.% H2
within 10 min under 2.8 W cm−2 irradiation, whereas the time to
achieve identical H2 desorption capacity using external heating is
doubled (Fig. 2h). Furthermore, upon increasing the loading ratio of
Cu1Ni1 to 20%, the temperature of MgH2 could be elevated to 238.1 °C,
7.7 °C higher than that with a loading ratio of Cu1Ni1 of 10% (Supple-
mentary Fig. 17a). The extent of dehydrogenation increases to 93.05%
under 2.5 W cm−2, compared with 83.28% under the addition of 10%
Cu1Ni1, together with a faster dehydrogenation rate (Supplementary
Fig. 17b, c), which could be attributed to the enhanced photo-to-
thermal effect combined with the catalytic effect in further reducing
the dehydrogenation temperature (Supplementary Fig. 17d). This fur-
ther validates that, with the increase ratio of CuNi alloys, the simulta-
neous enhancement of photothermal and catalytic effects of CuNi
alloys
would
mutually
contribute
to
the
better
solar-driven
performance.
Subsequently, the reversible H2 storage performance of MgH2
under the catalysis of CuNi is investigated, which is a critical challenge
in practical applications of solid-state hydrogen storage materials.
Interestingly, after the initial hydrogenation process, the color of
MgH2 catalyzed with Cu1Ni1, Cu1Ni2, and Cu1Ni3 turns deep black,
similar to that with Cu, while MgH2 catalyzed by Ni remains yellowish-
brown (Fig. 3a, inset). Surprisingly, MgH2 catalyzed by CuNi after the
initial hydrogenation process not only maintains strong absorption in
the ultraviolet–visible range, like that after ball-milling, but also exhi-
bits the signiﬁcant increase of overall absorbance in the near-infrared
region, with a relative absorbance from ~0.5 to ~0.9 (absorption ratio
from ~70 to ~86%) at a wavelength of 2000 nm (Fig. 3b). As a result, the
overall absorbance of MgH2 catalyzed by CuNi after cycling even
exceeds that of MgH2 catalyzed by Cu (Fig. 3a). In comparison, the
overall increase in absorbance of MgH2 catalyzed by Cu and Ni after
cycling is limited compared to that of CuNi (Supplementary Fig. 18).
This enables MgH2 catalyzed by CuNi to utilize the near-infrared irra-
diation (from 800 to 2000 nm) that accounts for 52% of the solar
spectrum and the enhanced full-spectrum (from 250 to 2000 nm)
absorption capability after cycling is achieved32, which is critical for
enhancing solar energy utilization efﬁciency and hence light-to-heat
performance.
Owing to the increased overall absorption in the near-infrared
range, the surface temperature of cycled MgH2 catalyzed by Cu1Ni1 is
higher than that of the ball-milled state under light irradiation (Fig. 3c).
Signiﬁcantly, under the irradiation intensity of 2.6 W cm−2
, the surface
temperature of MgH2 catalyzed by Cu1Ni1 after cycling is increased to
261.8 °C, which is 6.1% higher than that after ball-milling process,
correspondingly leading to the enhancement of H2 desorption rate of
the cycled MgH2. The ball-milled MgH2 catalyzed by Cu1Ni1 releases
5.39 wt.% H2 within 30 min, while the time required to release the same
H2 capacity could be shortened to 25 min with more H2 capacity for
MgH2 catalyzed by Cu1Ni1 after cycling (Fig. 3d and Supplementary
Fig. 19f). Similar phenomena of the increase of the surface temperature
(with a 3.7% increase) and the acceleration of H2 desorption could also
be observed for MgH2 under the catalysis of Cu1Ni2 and Cu1Ni3 after
cycling under the identical light intensity (Supplementary Fig. 19a, b).
In contrast, the elevation of the surface temperature of MgH2 catalyzed
by Cu or Ni after cycling is only around 2% (Supplementary Fig. 19c, d).

These results validate the signiﬁcant enhancement of photothermal
performance for MgH2 with the catalysis of CuNi after cycling, which
could further promote the hydrogen storage kinetics of MgH2.
Under the light density of 3.5 W cm−2, the operating temperatures
for H2 desorption and absorption of MgH2 are determined to be 277 °C
and 265 °C, respectively, in the ﬁrst cycle, and the corresponding
temperatures reach 288 °C and 270 °C in the second cycle (Supple-
mentary Fig. 20a, b). Impressively, a reversible capacity of 6.1 wt.%
could be achieved for MgH2 catalyzed by Cu1Ni1 after ten cycles of H2
adsorption and desorption, corresponding to a capacity retention of
95% (Fig. 3e). This result ﬁts well with the stable cycling performance of
MgH2 under the catalysis of Cu1Ni1 upon direct heating (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 10a, b), which indirectly demonstrates the excellent stability
of the catalytic effect under solar irradiation. On the other hand, it
could be clearly observed that nearly no change of the absorbance
performance could be observed for MgH2 under the catalysis of Cu1Ni1
after ten cycles compared with that after the initial hydrogenation
process (Supplementary Fig. 21a), corresponding to the stable
enhancement of surface temperature after cycling (Supplementary
Fig. 21b), indicating the well-preserved photothermal effect, which is
indispensable to realize stable solar-driven reversible hydrogen sto-
rage of MgH2. These results indicate that, the stable full-spectrum light

absorption capability after cycling, combined with the excellent sta-
bility of the catalytic effect, enables MgH2 catalyzed by CuNi to achieve
stable hydrogen storage reversibility driven by solar energy.
Although the relatively high light intensity is required to drive the
reversible hydrogen storage of MgH2 even under the catalysis of Cu1Ni1
alloys, the low-intensity light (～0.5 W cm−2) could be concentrated to
over 3.5 W cm−2 via Fresnel lens (Supplementary Fig. 22a), which makes
it possible to drive reversible hydrogen storage reactions by natural
light. To further demonstrate the feasibility of H2 desorption using
natural solar energy, an outdoor experiment of solar-driven H2 deso-
rption of MgH2 under the catalysis of Cu1Ni1 alloys are performed via a
low-cost PMMA Fresnel lens. A striking emergence of hydrogen bub-
bles from the pipe could be observed (Supplementary Fig. 22b and
Supplementary Movie 1), and the predominant phase in the XRD pat-
tern transforms into pure Mg following H2 desorption process (Sup-
plementary Fig. 22c), which offers direct evidence to the potential for
driving solid-state hydrogen storage of MgH2 by natural solar energy.
Mechanism of photothermal and catalytic effects
To disclose the evolution of the photothermal and catalytic effects of
CuNi, the phase and morphology change of MgH2 catalyzed by CuNi
before and after cycling is investigated. Direct observation of the
characteristic peaks other than MgH2 in XRD is challenging due to the
amorphization of the samples and/or the ultralow content of CuNi
(Supplementary Fig. 23b)33. Cu1Ni1 alloys with the characteristic lattice
spacing of Cu1Ni1, however, could be found in HRTEM (Supplementary
Fig. 24) with uniform distribution of Mg, Ni, Cu, and C elements,
indicating that Cu1Ni1 alloys still existsin the original state and
are evenly embedded inside of MgH2 after ball-milling. The initial
dehydrogenation of MgH2 under the catalysis of Ni and Cu leads to the
formation of Mg2Ni (PDF#00-035-1225) and Mg2Cu (PDF#04-008-
6025), respectively. By comparison, the characteristic peaks of
Mg2Ni(Cu) between Mg2Ni and Mg2Cu could be clearly observed with
the presence of a weak peak at around 38~39°, which provides addi-
tional evidence for the formation of Mg2Ni(Cu) during the initial
dehydrogenation of MgH2 catalyzed by Cu1Ni1 (Supplementary
Figs. 23d, e and 25a, b). The reﬁned structure of powder neutron dif-
fraction (PND) of MgH2 catalyzed by CuNi after total dehydrogenation
also conﬁrms the presence of the solid solution phase Mg2Ni1-x(Cu)x,
where Cu enters Ni1(0.5,0,0) and Ni2(0,0,0) sites within Mg2Ni (Sup-
plementary Fig. 26 and Supplementary Tables 4 and 5). The (200) and
(203) planes of Mg2Ni(Cu) are detected in HRTEM with a slight increase
compared to the corresponding planes of Mg2Ni (Supplementary
Fig. 27). These results indicate that, upon initial dehydrogenation
process, CuNi alloys would react with Mg at an atomic ratio of 2:1,
resulting in the in situ formation of Mg2Ni with Cu solution, i.e.,
Mg2Ni(Cu) ternary alloy. After rehydrogenation, the characteristic XRD
peaks of Mg2NiH4 and MgCu2 are detected (Fig. 4a and Supplementary
Fig. 23c), which agrees with the lattice fringes detected in TEM with the
observation of uniform distribution of MgCu2 and Mg2NiH4 within the
catalyst region (Supplementary Fig. 28). In addition, during the re-
dehydrogenation process, MgCu2 and Mg2NiH4 undergo solid solution
at the initial stage (less than 30% reaction progress), and a gradual low-
angle shift of Mg2NiH4 lattice towards the characteristic peak of
Mg2Ni(Cu) alloy could be observed due to the solid solution of Cu,
which demonstrates the presence of an intermediate state of
Mg2Ni(Cu)(H) during the hydrogenation process (Fig. 4b and Supple-
mentary Fig. 25c, d). More importantly, the characteristic peaks of
Mg2Ni(Cu) could still be clearly detected and remain unchanged in
XRD patterns even after ten cycles of H2 absorption and desorption.
No phase separation between Cu and Ni is observed in the EDS ele-
mental mapping results with uniform distribution of the characteristic
(200) lattice fringes of Mg2Ni(Cu) within Mg matrix. These results
provide direct evidence for the reversible formation of Mg2Ni(Cu)
upon cycling dehydrogenation, wherein structurally stable phases of
Mg2NiH4 and MgCu2 would form after hydrogenation, and they would
then rapidly transform into an intermediate state of Mg2Ni(Cu)(H)
during the subsequent dehydrogenation process, accompanied by
gradual alloying into single phase of Mg2Ni(Cu). Therefore, the rever-
sible formation of Mg2Ni(Cu) with a Cu atomic ratio of x in CuNi during
H2 desorption/absorption could be summarized:
2Mg2Ni1xCux + ð4  xÞH2 $ 2Mg2Ni1xðCuÞxðHÞ
$ ð2  2xÞMg2NiH4 + 3xMgH2 + xMgCu2
A similar reversible transformation between Mg2Ni(Cu), Mg2NiH4,
and MgCu2 during H2 desorption/absorption is also observed in MgH2
catalyzed by equimolar ratios of Cu and Ni, further validating the
reversible formation of Mg2Ni(Cu) (Supplementary Fig. 23f, g). In
addition, a loss in H2 capacity of the above system could nearly be
neglected under the catalysts of CuNi alloys with a loading ratio less
than 10% (Supplementary Table 6). After the initial hydrogenation
process, numerous interfaces and lattice distortions are observed at
the area between MgCu2, Mg2NiH4, and MgH2. In addition, the pre-
sence of embedded MgCu2 and atomic disorder are even found within
MgH2 lattice (Supplementary Fig. 28). After ten cycles of H2 deso-
rption, more lattice distortions and dislocations exist both at the
interfaces and within the alloys, and speciﬁcally, dislocation analysis at
region (4) reveals thatthese regions exhibit a higher degree of disorder
than Mg matrix (Supplementary Fig. 29). This is attributed to the solid-
state diffusion of Mg required for the transition between Mg2Ni(Cu)
and MgCu2
34, and the lattice distortions and disorders generated
during
H2
storage
reactions
could
reduce
local
thermal
conductivity35,36, which also helps to enhance the local thermal ﬁeld.
To reveal the mechanism behind the enhancement of solar
absorption of MgH2 under the catalysis of CuNi alloys before and after
cycling, the electronic density of states (DOS) is investigated. In terms
of pure MgH2, the valence band is mainly contributed by H(s) (79.3%)
with strong hybridization with Mg(sp) (20.7%) and the conduction
band is composed of 63.1% Mg(sp) and 36.9% H(s) (Supplementary
Fig. 30a). Strong ionic bonding occurs between Mg2+ and H−, resulting
in electrons primarily distributed around H atoms (Supplementary
Fig. 31a), while the electron distribution near the Fermi level approa-
ches zero, indicating distinct insulating properties (Supplementary
Figs. 30b and 32a, b). After adding CuNi alloys into MgH2, strong
absorption peaks in the visible light range could be ascribed to the
LSPR effect due to intra-band absorption (Supplementary Fig. 12a),
which occurs by the excitation of free electrons of conduction elec-
trons near the Fermi surface from sp-d hybridized atomic orbitals of Cu
(Supplementary Fig. 33), implying that the initial dehydrogenation
process is driven by the LSPR effectof CuNi. As mentioned above, CuNi
alloys would react with Mg during the dehydrogenation process,
leading to the formation of Mg2Ni(Cu) alloy and then the transfor-
mation of Mg2NiH4, MgCu2, and Mg2Ni(Cu)H4 upon reversible hydro-
genation. In comparison to the ionic bonding of MgH2, covalent bonds
between Ni(Cu) metal atoms and their neighbor H atoms exist in
Mg2NiH4 and Mg2Ni(Cu)H4 with clear electrons sharing (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 31b, c), leading to the weakening of Mg–H bonds and uniform
distribution of s-p band. Near the Fermi level, a relatively weak dis-
tribution of electrons could be observed in Mg2NiH4 with semi-
conductor properties (Fig. 4c, d and Supplementary Fig. 32c–e), while,
due to the solubility of Cu, a more ﬂattened hybridized orbital,
resembling a “ﬂat band”, appears, which is mainly Ni(d) orbitals
hybridized with weaker Mg(sp) and H(s) (Fig. 4e, f and Supplementary
Fig. 32f–h). As a result, a continuous band structure ﬁlls the vacant
Fermi level in Mg2Ni(Cu)H4 with metallic properties, together with
MgCu2 (Supplementary Fig. 30c), which induces the facile excitation of
electrons under light irradiation. Attributed to the robust hybridiza-
tion of Cu(d) and Ni(d) orbitals within the valence band, the d-band is

extended, which facilitates hybridization of them with Mg(sp) and H(s)
orbitals, thereby providing facile pathway for inter-/intra-band transi-
tions of electrons (including s-p and d orbitals) and leading to a broad
absorption spectrum within the visible to near-infrared range37–39. In
addition, the d electrons may undergo transitions to a higher energy
state when absorbing photons with more probability due to the
overlap of the localization of d orbitals, thereby inducing stronger
inter-band absorption40,41. More importantly, the localization of d
electrons introduced by the presence of Ni and Cu could be well-
preserved even after the formation of Mg2Ni(Cu) alloy after dehy-
drogenation. These results indicate that the observed broad absorp-
tion spectrum of the hydrogenated state after cycling results from the
synergistic effect of intra-band and inter-band transitions, and the
in situ formation of Mg2Ni(Cu) alloy expands the range of photo-
thermal effects.
On the other hand, although it is well known that Mg2Ni/Mg2NiH4
could function as the “hydrogen pump” to enhance hydrogen storage
performance of MgH2
42–44 as evidenced by the signiﬁcant decrease of
H2 desorption temperature of MgH2 induced by the catalysis of Ni, the
catalytic effect of CuNi in enhancing hydrogen storage performance of
MgH2 is even superior (Supplementary Fig. 7). To unveil the catalytic
mechanism of Mg2Ni(Cu)/Mg2Ni(Cu)H4 on MgH2, theoretical calcula-
tions are conducted based on density functional theory (DFT). The
average length of Mg–H bonds in Mg2Ni(Cu)H4 is calculated to be
2.03 Å, much longer than that in both MgH2 (1.93 Å) and Mg2NiH4
(1.95 Å) (Supplementary Fig. 34). This result demonstrates that, in
comparison to MgH2 and Mg2NiH4, the dehydrogenation of Mg2Ni(Cu)
H4 to form Mg2Ni(Cu) is thermodynamically favored, which corre-
sponds to the preferred formation of Mg2Ni(Cu) alloy at the initial
stage of re-dehydrogenation process (Fig. 4b). After the initial dehy-
drogenation of Mg2Ni(Cu)H4, under the presence of thus-formed
Mg2Ni(Cu) alloy, the barrier of H2 desorption from MgH2 is sig-
niﬁcantly reduced down to 1.13 eV, while this value reaches 3.12 eV for
pristine MgH2, validating the catalytic role of Mg2Ni(Cu) alloy in
improving the dehydrogenation performance of MgH2 (Fig. 5a, b and
Supplementary Fig. 35). More importantly, H atoms released from
MgH2 are spontaneously transferred into Mg2Ni(Cu) alloy, which
provides direct evidenceforthe “hydrogen pump” roleof Mg2Ni(Cu) in

improving the dehydrogenation of MgH2. In addition, the chemical
disorders introduced by the interfaces and lattice distortions in the
Mg–Cu lattice during cycling could enhance the reactivity of Mg and
Mg2Ni(Cu) due to the formation of the diffusion pathways of H atoms,
and
serve
as
preferential
catalytic
sites
for
H2
dissociation/
recombination45,46, which corresponds well with the theoretical cal-
culation results that the diffusion energy barriers of H atoms inside of
Mg2Ni(Cu) is slightly lower than that in the bulk phases of Mg2Ni. After
hydrogenation, the diffusion energy barrier of H atoms inside of
Mg2Ni(Cu)H4 (i.e., 0.62 eV) is signiﬁcantly lower than that of Mg2NiH4
(i.e., 1.48 eV) (Supplementary Fig. 36), which endows Mg2Ni(Cu)/
Mg2Ni(Cu)H4 superior “hydrogen pump” effect in improving hydrogen
storage performance of MgH2 than traditional Mg2Ni/Mg2NiH4. Hence,
the in situ stable formation of Mg2Ni(Cu) offers a kinetically favored
pathway for repeated dehydrogenation an hydrogenation of MgH2.
Furthermore, upon light irradiation, the presence of hot electrons
induces internal disparities in electron distribution within CuNi and
Mg2Ni(Cu) alloys as observed via in situ irradiated XPS (ISI-XPS)
(Supplementary Fig. 37a–e). Attributed to the work function differ-
ence, the hot electrons generated by the LSPR effect of Cu transferred
to Ni, leading to an increase in electron density around Ni (Supple-
mentary Fig. 38a, b), which enables Ni sites to contribute more elec-
trons to H bonded to Mg atoms of MgH2 (Supplementary Fig. 39a–d),
and hence leads to the weakening Mg–H bonds (Supplementary
Fig. 39e–h). As a result, compared to pure Ni with uniform electron
distribution, the electron enrichment at the Ni sites in CuNi and
Mg2Ni(Cu) alloys facilitates the elongation of Mg–H bonds from 1.87 Å
to 1.91 Å and 2.00 Å, respectively, while the impact of Cu sites remains
unchanged. The internal uneven electron distribution within CuNi and
Mg2Ni(Cu) alloys is conducive to promoting the dissociation of Mg–H
bonds
and
hence
improving
the
“hydrogen
pump”
effect
of
Mg2Ni(Cu)/Mg2Ni(Cu)H4. In addition, Mg does not affect the electron
transfer between CuNi under light irradiation due to its positive
charge, ensuring the promotion of Mg–H bonds dissociation by the
in situ well-preserved Mg2Ni(Cu) during cycling. These hot electrons
could be generated continuously under light irradiation and, however,
cannot be directly participate in the MgH2 dehydrogenation process,
which subsequently would decay into localized thermal energy47, act-
ing on catalytic sites in the form of heat, thereby elevating the local
temperature of catalytic sites and enhancing their catalytic effects.
Therefore, the in situ formation of Mg2Ni(Cu) alloys induces not
only photothermal effect via broadening the light absorption range to
cover the entire solar spectrum but also a light-enhanced “hydrogen
pump” role in improving reversible hydrogen storage performance of
MgH2 (Fig. 5c). More importantly, the in situ atomic reconstruction of
Mg2Ni(Cu) single phase upon repeated dehydrogenation process
realizes the continuous integration of photothermal and catalytic roles
to ensure the direct action of localized heat on the catalytic sites
without any heat loss, thereby achieving the ideal coupling of photo-
thermal and catalytic effects for driving reversible hydrogen storage of
MgH2 using solar energy.
Discussion
In summary, a single-component phase of Mg2Ni(Cu) ternary alloy via
atomic reconstruction is designed to achieve the ideal integration of
photothermal and catalytic effects to enhance the solar-driven
hydrogen storage performance of MgH2. Taking advantage of the
strong LSPR effect of CuNi alloys, the formation of Mg2Ni(Cu) ternary

alloy is realized through in situ alloying reaction between MgH2 and
CuNi alloys during the initial dehydrogenation process of MgH2 under
solar irradiation. Interestingly, Mg2Ni(Cu) alloy and its hydrogenated
state (i.e., Mg2Ni(Cu)H4) exhibit metallic properties with strengthened
intra/inter-band transitions, resulting in over 85% absorption in the
full-spectrum range, which effectively elevate the surface temperature
of MgH2 to 261.8 °C under 2.6 W cm−2 due to the promoted light-to-
heat conversion efﬁciency. More importantly, in comparison with
MgH2, the hydrogen storage reaction of Mg2Ni(Cu) is thermo-
dynamically and kinetically favored resulting from the weakening of
Mg–H bonds and the low migration barrier of hydrogen atoms in both
Mg2Ni(Cu) and Mg2Ni(Cu)H4, which in turn provides a facile pathway
for the spontaneous breaking of Mg–H bonds of MgH2. The uneven
distribution of the light-induced hot electrons within CuNi and
Mg2Ni(Cu) alloys also contributes to the effective weakening of Mg–H
bonds of MgH2 and the accelerated formation of Mg2Ni(Cu)/
Mg2Ni(Cu)H4, hence resulting in a light-enhanced “hydrogen pump”
effect in improving cycling hydrogenation and dehydrogenation of
MgH2 and the signiﬁcant decrease of the apparent activation energy
required for driving hydrogen storage of MgH2. As a result, the
reversible formation of Mg2Ni(Cu) ideally integrates the photothermal
and catalytic effects to ensure that the direct action of localized heat
on the catalytic sites without any heatloss, which leads to the complete
dehydrogenation of MgH2 within 15 min under the irradiation intensity
of 3.5 W cm−2. Moreover, the stable reversibility between Mg2Ni(Cu)
could be well-preserved during cycling H2 desorption and adsorption,
which results in the excellent stability of photothermal effect with full-
spectrum light absorption and catalytic effect, leading to a reversible
hydrogen storage capacity of 6.1 wt.% with a capacity retention of 95%.
Our work expands the functionality of the alloying strategy to modify
metal hydrides under solar irradiation and may enlighten the design of
efﬁcient photothermal-catalytic solar-driven reversible hydrogen sto-
rage systems and solar-chemical energy reactions.
Methods
Materials
Copper nitrate hydrate (Cu(NO3)2·3H2O), nickel nitrate hexahydrate
(Ni(NO3)2·6H2O), tartaric acid (C4H6O6), glycerol (C3H8O3), and poly-
ethylene glycol were all purchased from Sinopharm chemical reagent
co., Ltd. Magnesium hydride (MgH2) was purchased from Alfa Aesar.
All chemicals were used without further puriﬁcation.
Synthesis of CuNi alloys
CuNi alloys were synthesized by a one-step solvothermal calcination
method.
Firstly,
386.6 mg
of
Cu(NO3)2·3H2O,
465.5 mg
of
Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, and 1200 mg of tartaric acid were added to 8 mL of
deionized water and stirred until completely dissolved, referred to as
Solution 1. Subsequently, 2 g of polyethylene glycol, 20 ml of glycerol,
and 5 ml of deionized water were mixed and sonicated for 10 min,
referred to as Solution 2. The two obtained solutions were mixed and
stirred for 1 h to achieve uniform dispersion and transferred to a Teﬂon
stainless-steel autoclave and heated at 150 °C for 3 h. The resulting
product was centrifuged at about 3500×g and washed three times with
anhydrous ethanol to remove excess reactants and impurities. The
centrifuged product was then dried completely in an 80 °C oven for
12 h. The dried product was placed in a tube furnace and heated at a
rate of 3 °C min−1 in an H2/Ar atmosphere (with 5% H2) up to 800 °C for
2 h. CuNi alloys with encapsulated carbon layer were obtained through
the gas reduction method, with a Cu to Ni atomic ratio of 1:1, denoted
as Cu1Ni1. By varying the relative ratios of Cu and Ni salts added to
precursor Solution 1, the ratio of CuNi alloys could be adjusted. Under
the same reaction conditions, adding 184.74 mg Cu(NO3)2·3H2O with
667.1 mg Ni(NO3)2·6H2O yielded Cu1Ni3 with a Cu-to-Ni atomic ratio of
1:3. Without adding Cu(NO3)2·3H2O or Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, Ni and Cu were
obtained.
Synthesis of MgH2 catalyzed by CuNi alloys
CuNi–MgH2 composite was synthesized via mechanical milling. Com-
mercially available MgH2 with 10 wt.% catalysts were added in a 100-mL
stainless-steel container under an argon atmosphere. The ball-to-
powder weight ratio was controlled to be 100:1, and the rotation speed
of the miller was maintained at 500 rpm (alternate clockwise and
counterclockwise rotation) for 12 h (5-min-stop every 30 min). Ball-
milled MgH2, Cu–MgH2, and Ni–MgH2 composites were also prepared
under identical processing conditions. All samples were handled in an
argon-ﬁlled glovebox with O2 and H2O <0.1 ppm.
Materials characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD, D8 advance, Bruker AXS, USA) with Cu Kα
radiation (1.542 Å) at 40 kV and 40 mA was used to determine the
phase compositions. The materials were protected against oxidation
from the air by adhesive tape (amorphous with a broad peak around
2θ ≈20°). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results were
obtained on a Thermo Scientiﬁc K-Alpha system equipped with a dual
X-raysource, adopting an Al Kα (1486.6 eV) anode with a hemispherical
energy analyzer. In situ irradiated XPS (ISI-XPS) were performed on a
Thermoﬁsher ESCALAB 250Xi under Xe lamp irradiation. Time-of-
ﬂight (TOF) powder neutron diffraction (NPD) data were collected
from a general-purpose powder diffractometer (GPPD) (90° bank) at
the China Spallation Neutron Source (CSNS), Dongguan, China. Neu-
tron diffraction patterns were recorded at room temperature. Rietveld
reﬁnements of the NPD patterns were performed using the GSAS
software. The morphologies of the synthesized catalysts and MgH2
catalyzed by CuNi with different states were observed by scanning
electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL 7500FA, Japan) and transmission
electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL JEM-2100F, Japan). The Cu and Ni
contents of samples were measured by an inductively coupled plasma
source mass spectrometer (ICP-MS, Agilent ICPOES730, USA). The
absorption
spectra
of
samples
in
the
wavelength
range
of
200~2200 nm
were
determined
using
a
UV–vis–NIR
Spectro-
photometer (Lambda 750, Perkin-Elmer, USA). The content of carbon
and alloy were analyzed by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA, Dis-
covery TGA 550, USA) from room temperature to 800 °C at a rate of
10 °C min−1 in the air.
The light source was a 300 W Xenon lamp (Perfect Light Co., Ltd.,
China), and the light intensity was adjusted by tuning the current of the
light source and the distance between the light source and the sample.
The light intensity of the 300 W Xenon lamp was measured by an
optical power meter (PL-MW2000, Perfect Light Co., Ltd., China). A
short-wave infrared thermometer (DGE44N, range: 75~50 °C, DIAS,
Germany) was used to measure the surface temperature of the com-
posites during the reaction process under vacuum conditions through
a sapphire window.
Hydrogen storage measurements
Temperature-programmed
desorption
(TPD),
isothermal
dehy-
drogenation tests, and corresponding hydrogenation process of the
as-prepared samples were conducted on a home-built high-pressure
gas sorption apparatus (HPSA-auto), which was carefully calibrated by
adopting LaNi5 as a reference sample in terms of hydrogen storage
capacity and guaranteed accuracy of ± 1%. All samples’ hydrogen
capacity (wt.%) is calculated based on the total mass of MgH2 and the
additives.
As for electric heating, for each volumetric temperature-
programmed desorption measurement, approximately 30 mg of ball-
milled sample were conducted under vacuum from room temperature
to preset temperature (400 °C) at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 under an
initial pressure lower than 0.0001 bar, with an electric heater to
determine the hydrogen release properties of the MgH2 materials
brieﬂy. The isothermal H2 desorption and absorption test were han-
dled by rapidly heating up to the target temperature followed by

keeping at the preset temperature. In the isothermal H2 absorption
experiment, ~80 mg of samples were used for hydrogenation under
the hydrogen pressure of 10 atm.
As for light irradiation, customized solar-driven H2 absorption and
desorption equipment (Supplementary Fig. 11) was used to perform
experiments under solar energy. The adjustment of the light intensity
was realized by changing the current intensity. The light was incident
through the above sapphire window, and the outlet of the reactor was
connected to the PCT equipment. The temperature of the material
during the H2 absorption and desorption was measured by a short-
wave infrared thermometer. About 30 mg samples were taken each
time and pressed into pieces with a diameter of 15 mm under a pres-
sure of 5 tons to ensure the stability of the test and the comparability of
the results. Glass ﬁber sheets made up of mainly SiO2 with low thermal
conductivity, which have limited absorption of solar energy, were
placed at the bottom of the reactor to reduce the heat dissipation of
the material to the outside. The sample was placed on an Al2O3 ceramic
sheet, which could be isolated from the glass ﬁber to prevent the
sample from oxidizing by reacting with the insulation layer due to the
high temperature during the reaction. The expansion of internal gases
within the reactor due to solar irradiation has a negligible impact on
the H2 capacity results, as a large chamber, 25 times the volume of the
reactor, was opened during the dehydrogenation tests to minimize
testing errors. The hydrogen pressure used for H2 absorption under
solar irradiation was consistent with that using electric heating.
Theoretical calculations
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out using the
Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP)48,49. Core-valence electron
interaction was described by the projector-augmented wave (PAW)
method50, and electron exchange-correlation was processed by gen-
eralized gradient approximation (GGA) of Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof
(PBE) functional51–53. The van der Waals (vdW) correction DFT-D3 pro-
posed
by
Grimme
was
employed
to
include
the
dispersion
interaction54. A plane wave energy cutoff of 520 eV and Gamma-
centered k-point meshes (3 × 3 × 1) with same density were applied to
surface calculations. A 7 × 7 × 7 Gamma-centered k-point meshes is
used for the dos calculation of Cu, MgH2, Mg2NiH4, Mg2Ni(Cu)H4, and
10 × 10 × 10 is used for the dos calculation of CuNi. For all slab struc-
tures, a 20 Å vacuum layer in the z-direction is added to prevent surface
interactions between the upper and lower surfaces. In energy band
calculation, the number of k-points is uniformly 20, and the k-path and
energy band information are exported by the VASP post-processing
tool VASPKIT. The Gaussian smearing method was used with a width of
0.05 eV, and spin polarization was considered in all calculations. The
structures were relaxed until the forces and total energy on all atoms
were converged to less than 0.05 eV Å−1 and 1 × 10−5 eV. The MgH2 dis-
sociation and diffusions of H in various crystal lattices are simulated
using the climbing-image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) method55. The
climbing-image nudged elastic band (Cl-NEB) method developed by
Henkelman et al. was employed to locate the transition states of the
MgH2 dissociation and diffusions of H in various crystal lattice56,57.
