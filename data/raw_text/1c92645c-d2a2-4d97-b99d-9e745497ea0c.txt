Abstract 
The effects of various alloying elements on the performance of Mg-Mg2 Ni hydrogen storage alloys were investigated by performing ﬁrst- 
principles density functional theory calculations. We examined the important characteristics of hydrogen storage alloys by considering both 
Mg-based solid solution and Mg2 Ni-based intermetallic compound phases, where the hydride forms are MgH2 and Mg2 NiH4 , respectively. 
In particular, qualitatively valid information for predicting changes in plateau pressures in the pressure-composition-temperature (PCT) curve 
was provided by calculating changes in the energy of related hydrogenation reactions. The effects of alloying elements on volume changes 
due to hydrogenation reactions were also obtained to provide additional criteria for the practical use of hydrogen storage alloys. For the 
Mg2 Ni-based intermetallic compound, we examined the site preference of each alloying element, considering the designated stoichiometry 
of the base alloy. Based on the revealed site preferences, the effects of various possible alloying elements on the properties of Mg2 Ni-based 
hydrides were also examined. Electronic structure analyses were further conducted to elucidate the detailed mechanisms underlying the role 
of the additional solute elements.

1. Introduction 
Considering utilizing non-renewable energy sources, such 
as fossil fuels, has depleted energy resources and caused en- 
vironmental pollution, hydrogen has attracted increasing at- 
tention as a renewable energy source. To enhance the hy- 
drogen economy, developing technologies that realize the ef- 
ﬁcient and safe storage and transportation of hydrogen is 
highly desirable. Among several possible hydrogen storage 
technologies, the storage of hydrogen in the solid state, such

as using hydrogen storage alloys, has attracted much atten- 
tion owing to its high storage capacity and superior safety 
compared to other storage technologies [ 1–5 ]. In particular, 
Mg alloys are considered promising hydrogen storage mate- 
rials owing to their lightweight, low cost, and high hydrogen 
storage capacity ( ∼7.62 wt.%) properties [ 6 , 7 ]. For example, 
pure Mg reacts with hydrogen to form magnesium hydride 
(MgH2 ), which enables the transportation of large amounts 
of hydrogen under ambient conditions.

However, MgH2 itself is not a promising hydrogen stor- 
age material because it forms strong bonds with hydrogen 
( H = ∼−74.5 kJ/mol H2 ) [ 8 , 9 ], making the dehydrogena-

tion process too challenging [ 10–13 ]. To enhance the dehy- 
drogenation process of MgH2 , recent studies have focused on 
ways to improve both the thermodynamic and kinetic proper- 
ties. For instance, it was reported that combining LiBH4 and 
YNi5 with MgH2 can signiﬁcantly enhance hydrogen storage 
properties, achieving a reversible hydrogen storage capacity 
of 6.42 wt.% after 110 cycles at 300 °C [ 14 ]. The forma- 
tion of in-situ phase such as MgNi3 B2 was identiﬁed as a 
critical factor in accelerating dehydrogenation kinetics while 
maintaining high storage performance [ 14 ]. Moreover, the de- 
velopment of one-step approaches for hydrogen generation, 
storage, transportation, and application without the need for 
hydrogen compression has been actively explored [ 15–17 ]. In 
particular, hydrogen storage techniques using Mg or MgH2 
as a reduction agent show signiﬁcant potential to simplify 
systems and reduce costs. For example, previous studies re- 
ported that the use of Mg/MgH2 for Li(Na)BH4 regeneration 
provides a uniﬁed solution for hydrogen storage and gener- 
ation [ 18 , 19 ]. These innovative Mg-based hydrogen storage 
technologies play a crucial role in promoting the use of hy- 
drogen as a next-generation clean energy source, providing 
essential solutions for efﬁcient and safe energy storage. 
The performance of hydrogen storage alloys is generally 
ascertained by examining pressure-composition-temperature 
(PCT) curves. The PCT curve illustrates the hydrogen storage 
capacity, temperature, and pressure at which a material can 
be operated. Thus, the relevant control of the PCT curve is 
an important requirement in the practical implementation of 
hydrogen storage alloys. However, MgH2 hydrides require ex- 
tremely low desorption pressures or high temperatures above 
325 °C to release hydrogen when reverting to pure Mg. 
To address this issue, numerous studies have been con- 
ducted [ 6 , 20–28 ] based on including alloying [ 6 , 29–32 ] and 
catalytic addition [ 33 , 34 ], and the partial substitution of Mg 
with other elements is considered the most promising route 
to decrease the stability of hydrides. For example, adding 
transition metals to Mg can effectively weaken the interac- 
tions between Mg and H, forming intermetallic compounds 
[ 8 ]. Among the possible choices for an additional element in 
the binary combination, the most notable is Ni. For example, 
Shen et al. [ 35 ] demonstrated that using nano-sized catalysts 
like ultraﬁne Ni can signiﬁcantly enhance the kinetics and re- 
versible hydrogen storage capacity of MgH2 -based compos- 
ites. Moreover, the incorporation of Ni was reported to reduce 
the dehydrogenation activation energy by up to 26.9 % com- 
pared to pure Mg, enabling more efﬁcient hydrogen release 
even at lower temperatures [ 35–38 ]. As shown in the binary 
Mg-Ni phase diagram [ 39 ], the Mg-Ni system involves two 
intermetallic compounds ( e.g. , Mg2 Ni and MgNi2 ). Among 
various possible compositions of the Mg-Ni binary alloy, the 
Mg-rich compositions within the two-phase stable region with 
hcp solid solution phase and the Mg2 Ni compound have at- 
tracted much attention because the Mg2 Ni can contribute to 
improving the hydrogen desorption kinetics and reduce the 
hydrogen desorption temperature to be ∼250 °C [ 40 ]. The 
Mg2 Ni compound alone can be another hydrogen storage al- 
loy because it can form a stable hydride (Mg2 NiH4 ) via the 
following reaction [ 12 , 41–43 ]. 
Mg2 Ni + 2H2 → Mg2 Ni H4 
(2) 
The dehydrogenation process of Mg2 Ni alloys has been 
considerably improved compared to that of existing Mg-based 
hydrogen storage alloys. With the appropriate selection of 
composition and processing conditions, a lamellar eutectic 
mixture with an Mg-rich hcp solid solution and Mg2 Ni com- 
pound phases can be readily formed. The Mg-Mg2 Ni eutectic 
structure with ﬁnely distributed interfaces facilitated the dis- 
sociation of hydrogen molecules and the penetration of hy- 
drogen atoms [ 44 ]. Thus, adding Ni forms a secondary phase 
that acts as a ‘hydrogen pump’ during dehydrogenation pro- 
cess [ 7 , 45–47 ]. 
However, challenges remain in the development of prac- 
tical Mg-Mg2 Ni hydrogen storage alloys, such as an overall 
increase in the hydrogen storage capacity because the Mg2 Ni- 
based hydride exhibits a lower hydrogen storage capacity 
( ∼3.6 wt.%) [ 48 ] than the Mg-based hydride ( ∼7.62 wt.%) 
[ 49 ]. Moreover, as the Mg2 Ni still exhibits a comparably high 
stability of hydride phase ( H = ∼−64 kJ/mol H2 ), the sta- 
bility of the hydride could be further decreased to achieve 
optimal performance [ 50 ]. In particular, the dual tuning of 
thermodynamic and kinetic properties through alloying pro- 
cesses has emerged as a key solution to overcome these chal- 
lenges [ 14 ]. Therefore, considering additional ternary alloying 
elements is highly desirable for the practical application of 
Mg-Mg2 Ni hydrogen storage alloys, and several experimental 
studies were performed in this direction [ 6 , 38 , 51 , 52 ]. How- 
ever, designing multicomponent alloys within the vast realm 
of the compositional space only via experiments can be chal- 
lenging. In particular, adding alloying elements can change 
the properties of the Mg-rich solid solution phase ( i.e. , MgH2 
hydride) as well as the properties of Mg2 Ni compounds ( i.e. , 
Mg2 NiH4 hydride) to different degrees; however, there is not 
enough information on the speciﬁc roles of various alloying 
elements. 
First-principles density functional theory (DFT) calcula- 
tions can be an ideal method to supplement experiments by 
determining the effects of alloying elements on properties re- 
lated to the hydrogen storage. For example, Kelkar et al. [ 26 ] 
utilized the DFT calculation to predict the effect of additional 
Al and Si on the hydrogen adsorption properties of MgH2 
hydrides and reported that adding Al and Si destabilizes the 
hydride and enhances its dehydrogenation properties. Simi- 
larly, Hussain et al. [ 27 ] investigated the doping effect of 
transition metals (Al, Ti, Fe, Ni, Cu, and Nb) to modulate 
the thermodynamic stability of MgH2 hydrides. Adding ele- 
ments to Mg alloys effectively reduced the dehydrogenation 
temperature and stability of the hydride. In the case of the 
Mg2 Ni-based hydrogen storage alloys, several DFT studies 
have explored the effects of alloying elements. For example, 
Liu et al. [ 53 ] examined the effect of substitutional Si on the 
stability of Mg2 NiH4 hydrides and reported that adding Si 
destabilized the hydrides. Li et al. [ 24 ] reported that when Y 
atoms occupy Mg sites, the stability of the Mg2 NiH4 hydride 
is decreased. Zeng et al. [ 25 ] examined the doping effect of 

4576

Ag and Al and reported that substitutional Ag and Al atoms 
at the Mg sites can destabilize the Mg2 NiH4 hydride. 
Although several DFT studies have been performed for 
selected alloying elements, systematic analysis of the role of 
each solute element in Mg-Mg2 Ni hydrogen storage alloys 
remains lacking. In this study, we conducted comprehensive 
DFT calculations for a wide range of alloying elements to 
provide substantial data for further alloying design processes. 
In particular, identifying possible substitution positions ( i.e. , 
site preferences) of solute elements in the Mg2 Ni structure 
was prioritized because they signiﬁcantly determine the over- 
all substitutional effects. Once the site preference of the solute 
elements was determined, the enthalpy of the hydrogenation 
reaction was calculated to ascertain the effect of the solute 
elements on the changes in the PCT curve. Furthermore, the 
volume change of the hydrogen storage alloy due to the hy- 
drogenation reaction, an additional factor to be considered 
in the practical alloying design process, was determined. Fi- 
nally, the effects of the alloying elements on the electronic 
properties and bonding characteristics were examined to gain 
more detailed insights into the inﬂuence of solute elements on 
the hydrogen storage properties. The results of this study are 
expected to provide qualitatively valid information for design- 
ing new Mg-Mg2 Ni hydrogen storage alloys with appropriate 
performance for the required applications. 
2. Methodology 
DFT calculations were performed using the Vienna ab ini- 
tio simulation package (VASP) code within the projector- 
augmented wave (PAW) method [ 54 , 55 ]. The exchange- 
correlation function was described utilizing the general- 
ized gradient approximation (GGA) and the Perdew–Burke–
Ernzerhof method [ 56 , 57 ]. A cutoff energy of 360 eV was 
selected for the plane-wave basis set considering reasonable 
convergence and computational efﬁciency. The Brillouin zone 
was sampled via the Methfessel–Paxton smearing method, 
with a smearing width of 0.1 eV [ 58 ]. A relevant set of - 
centered k -point meshes, a density of approximately 9000 k - 
points per reciprocal atom, was employed for each type of 
supercell, as summarized in Table 1 . The selection of these 
k -point meshes was based on convergence tests, where all su- 
percells achieved energy convergence within an energy differ- 
ence of < 10−5 eV/atom, conﬁrming that the selected k -point 
densities are sufﬁcient for accurate energy calculations related 
to target properties. We also conﬁrmed that this selection en- 
sures reliable and consistent results for electronic property 
calculations. All the DFT calculations were performed with 
full relaxation of the atomic positions and cell parameters 
( i.e. , the dimensions and angles of the supercell). Each struc- 
ture was optimized under a convergence criterion of 10–6 eV 
and 10–2 eV/ ˚A for energy and force, respectively. 
While various elements of the periodic table (Ag, Al, As, 
Au, Ba, Be, Bi, Ca, Cd, Ce, Co, Cr, Cs, Cu, Fe, Ga, Gd, Ge, 
Hf, Hg, In, Ir, K, La, Li, Mg, Mo, Na, Nb, Nd, Ni, Os, P, Pb, 
Pd, Pt, Rb, Re, Rh, Ru, S, Sb, Sc , Se, Si, Sn, Sr, Ta, Tc, Te, 
Tl, V, W, Y, Zn, and Zr) were considered as candidates, only 
the impact of substitutional solute elements was considered, 
with interstitial forms excluded considering the storage capac- 
ity of hydrogen. Inert gases, halogens, radioactive elements, 
and several rare earth elements were excluded. Pseudopoten- 
tials recommended by the VASP library were used in the 
calculations. In the present study, zero-point vibration contri- 
butions to the energy values were not considered because the 
objective was to provide qualitatively valid information for 
the rapid screening of candidate elements rather than provid- 
ing quantitative data. 
As aforementioned, Mg-based hydrogen storage alloys are 
associated with a hydride form of MgH2 under the hydro- 
gen charging condition. Fig. 1 shows a schematic of pure Mg 
and MgH2 hydride structures used in the present DFT cal- 
culations. Depending on temperature and pressure conditions, 
MgH2 can crystallize as either α-MgH2 or γ -MgH2 . Under 
the ambient conditions, a stable one is the rutile-type α-MgH2 
structure, which has a crystal structure of tetragonal P42 /mnm 
(space group No 136). The unit cell contains two Mg and four 
H atoms while the Mg ²+ ion forms a bond with six equivalent 
H1- ions to create a mixture of MgH6 octahedral ( Fig. 1 ). This 
local structure involves two shorter (1.93 ˚A) and four longer 
(1.94 ˚A) Mg-H bonds [ 59 ]. Supercells with 96 atoms ( i.e. , 32 
Mg and 64 H atoms), generated by a 2 × 2 × 4 duplication 
of the unit cell with six atoms, were used to calculate the 
related properties. 
When a pressure higher than ∼0.39 GPa is applied, α- 
MgH2 transforms into the γ -MgH2 , which has a α-PbO2 -type 
crystal structure of orthorhombic Pbcn (space group No 60) 
[ 59–61 ]. The unit cell contains four Mg and eight H atoms, 
where the H1- ions bonded with three equivalent Mg2 + ions in 
a triangular plan as shown in Fig. 1 . In other words, there are 
three different types of Mg-H bonds in this structure, each of

which has a Mg-H bond length in the range of 1.90–1.99 ˚A. 
To apply the same conditions as in α-MgH2 , a 2 × 2 × 2 du- 
plication of the unit cell was performed. In this study, super- 
cells with a total of 96 atoms ( e.g. , Mg32 H64 and Mg31 X1 H64 ) 
for MgH2 hydrides and those with a total of 32 atoms for pure 
Mg ( e.g. , Mg32 ) and solid solutions ( e.g. , Mg32 and Mg31 X1 ) 
were consistently used to examine the inﬂuence of solute el- 
ements. 
Mg2 Ni has a crystal structure of hexagonal P62 22 (space 
group No 180) [ 62 ]. As shown in Fig. 2 , the unit cell 
of Mg2 Ni contains 12 Mg atoms and 6 Ni atoms. In this 
study, a supercell containing 72 metal atoms, constructed by 
a 2 × 2 × 1 duplication of the unit cell, was used for fur- 
ther investigation. Mg2 NiH4 exhibits intriguing phase trans- 
formation characteristics. At temperatures above 510 K, the 
high-temperature (HT) cubic structure is maintained. At tem- 
peratures below 510 K, it transforms into two low-temperature 
(LT) structures. The ﬁrst is a monoclinic LT1 structure and the 
second is a twinned orthorhombic LT2 structure [ 63 ]. Among 
these LT hydrides, the present study focuses on the more ther- 
modynamically stable LT1 phase, which has a crystal struc- 
ture of C2/c (space group No 15) [ 64 ]. As shown in Fig. 2 , 
the unit cell of Mg2 NiH4 contains 16 Mg atoms, 8 Ni atoms, 
and 32 H atoms. Supercells containing 72 metal atoms and 96 
H atoms, constructed by a 1 × 1 × 3 duplication of the unit 
cell, were used for further examination to match the num- 
ber of atoms between the hydride and the corresponding base 
alloy conﬁgurations. 
In the case of the Mg2 Ni compound, the position of the 
solute atom in the sublattice structure critically determines the 
related properties. To understand the inﬂuence of each solute 
element, we used supercells with a solute atom in different 
sublattices, e.g. , Mg47 X1 Ni24 and Mg47 X1 Ni24 H96 conﬁgura- 
tions for the substitution of a Mg site and Mg48 Ni23 X1 and 
Mg48 Ni23 X1 H96 conﬁgurations for the substitution of a Ni 
site. The present study aims to provide only the qualitative 
effect of alloying elements on the properties, considering the 
substitution of only one atom in a supercell, without consid- 
ering the detailed concentration effect. As shown in Fig. 2 , a 
solute atom can be substituted at a single Ni site or three dif- 
ferent Mg sites (Mg1, Mg2, and Mg3). Therefore, we treated 
these three Mg sites separately in the property calculations 
and derived an average value for further examination. 
To validate the reliability of the present DFT calculations, 
the optimized structural parameters of hcp Mg, α-MgH2 , 
γ -MgH2 , Mg2 Ni, and Mg2 NiH4 structures were compared 
with the experimentally reported values as listed in Table 2 . 
The obtained results were consistent with the experimen-

3. Results and discussion 
3.1. Energy of hydrogenation reactions of Mg-based storage 
alloys 
Magnesium-based hydrogen storage alloys undergo a spon- 
taneous reaction with hydrogen, as shown in Eq. (1) , which 
is associated with heat dissipation. To improve the practical 
utility of Mg-based hydrogen storage alloys, it is crucial to 
tailor the absorption and desorption characteristics of hydro- 
gen in the PCT curve, particularly the location of the plateau 
pressures. The plateau pressure ( Peq ) can be calculated using 
the van’t Hoff equation: 
ln 
Peq 
P0 

= H0 
RT −S0 
R ,
(3) 
where Peq is the plateau pressure, P0 is the standard pressure 
of 1 atm, R is the ideal gas constant, T is the temperature, 
H0 is the standard reaction enthalpy, and S0 is the standard 
reaction entropy. From Eq. (3) , it can be seen that the plateau 
pressure is inﬂuenced by changes of the hydrogenation re- 
action enthalpy and entropy. For example, a more negative 
H0 indicates a lower plateau pressure and the stabilization 
of the hydride phase, and vice versa . However, it is not trivial 
to derive the exact value of the plateau pressure using DFT 
calculations alone. This is because of the inherent difﬁculty 
of DFT calculations in accurately predicting entropy changes. 
Alternatively, DFT calculations can be readily performed to 
obtain the energy difference between the metal and hydride 
phases at 0 K, closely correlated with the enthalpy change 
due to hydrogenation reactions. In other words, we can ob- 
tain the energy difference between the base alloy and hydride 
phase at 0 K by DFT calculation, roughly corresponding to 
the H0 . 
Speciﬁcally, we adopted a qualitative approach, where the 
relative changes in the energy of the hydrogenation reaction 
( Er ) are used to infer the variation trend of the plateau pres- 
sure. In other words, a less negative Er indicates a reduced 
stability of the hydride phase, which correlates with an in- 
crease in the plateau pressure, indicating that the desorption 
of hydrogen is more favorable at lower temperatures. Con- 
versely, a more negative Er indicates an increased stability 
of the hydride phase, which correlates with a decrease in 
the plateau pressure. These trends align with the van’t Hoff 
equation, which shows the correlation between the plateau 
pressure and reaction enthalpy. Thus, while an exact quan- 
titative prediction of plateau pressures is beyond the scope 
of the present study, the qualitative trends inferred from Er 
provide valuable insights for the alloy design to tune overall 
hydrogen storage properties. The energy of the hydrogenation 
reaction from Mg to MgH2 hydride was examined by DFT 
calculations using the following equation: 
Er = E( Mg32 H64 ) −E( Mg32 ) −32E( H2 ) 
32 
,
(4) 
where E (Mg32 H64 ) and E (Mg32 ), the energy values of the hy- 
dride and pure Mg, respectively, were obtained from DFT 
calculations for the supercell structures. The energy value of 
H2 molecules, E (H2 ), was obtained by the calculation with 
a sufﬁcient vacuum region in a cell. Table 3 lists the calcu- 
lated Er for the hydrogenation reaction from pure Mg to 
MgH2 hydride compared to the reported experimental value 
and previous calculations. It should be noted that the energy 
difference at 0 K obtained by DFT calculations does not ex- 
actly correspond to the enthalpy change measured experimen- 
tally because it can be affected by the temperature. There is 
an overall discrepancy between the Hr measured by exper- 
iments and Er predicted by usual DFT calculations. There- 
fore, the primary objective of this study was not to provide 
the absolute plateau pressure and enthalpy values but rather to 
predict the relative change in energy due to the hydrogenation 
reaction with the addition of alloying elements. 
To examine the alloying effect, we considered a dilute con- 
centration of solute elements in which a single substitution 
atom was located in a supercell ( i.e. , Mg31 X1 H64 and Mg31 X1 
where X is the solute element), and the Er values were ob- 
tained by applying an equation similar to Eq. (4) . Calculations 
for α-MgH2 and γ -MgH2 were independently performed, and 
results are summarized in Table 4 and Fig. 3 . It should be 
noted that the selected concentration considered in the present 
study (1/32) would be impractical for some alloying elements

the present study provides only qualitatively valid information 
on the effects of the alloying elements. 
Fig. 3 shows the calculated energy values for the hydro- 
genation reaction. This shows that each solute element affects 
the stability of the hydrides differently, but there is a general 
trend for the hydride phases to become unstable with the addi- 
tion of solute elements ( i.e. , an increase in plateau pressures).

the hydride phases. Conversely, adding elements in the same 
group as Mg ( e.g. , Ca, Sr, and Ba) was found to lower the hy- 
drogenation reaction energy more than that of MgH2 hydrides 
( i.e. , decrease in plateau pressures). Comparing the α-MgH2 
and γ -MgH2 hydrides, we observed no signiﬁcant difference 
in the inﬂuence of solute elements. 
Table 5 presents a comparison between the present DFT 
predictions and reported experimental results, which enabled 
us to ascertain our predictions of the impact of the solute 
element on Mg-based hydrogen storage alloys. Although the 
solute concentrations differed from the reported experimental 
results, we could roughly estimate the impact of each solute 
element. Previous experiments have mostly focused on can- 
didate solute elements that can destabilize MgH2 hydride. As 
shown in Table 5 , all the solute elements considered in previ- 
ous studies demonstrated destabilization of the hydride phase, 
which is consistent with the present DFT calculations. The 
DFT prediction also reproduced the magnitude ( i.e. , labeled 
as ‘strong, moderate, and weak’ in Table 5 ) of the changes, 
emphasizing its predictive ability. For example, Zhong et al. 
[ 79 ] reported that incorporating Al into Mg-based storage al- 
loys resulted in a reduction in the dehydriding enthalpy and 
an increase in plateau pressures. According to the work, the 
reaction enthalpy of the Mg0.95 Al0.05 alloy is measured as 
−72.1 kJ/mol H2 , where the stability of hydride is decreased 
compared to that of pure Mg (−77.9 kJ/mol H2 ). Another 
result on the Mg0.95 In0.05 alloy by Zhong et al. [ 81 ] reported 
a more pronounced destabilizing effect of the hydride phase 
(−67.8 kJ/mol H2 ) at the same solute composition. These re- 
sults demonstrate that the presence of In atoms has a greater 
destabilizing effect than the presence of Al atoms. As il- 
lustrated in Fig. 3 , the present DFT calculation well repro- 
duce this trend ( i.e. , −47.27 kJ/mol H2 for Mg31 Al1 H64 and 
−42.92 kJ/mol H2 for Mg31 In1 H64 ). 
Another aspect that should be considered in the design of 
hydrogen storage alloys is the volume change caused by the 
hydrogenation reaction ( i.e. , dilatation). When hydrogen stor- 
age alloys transform into hydrides under hydrogen charging 
conditions, they usually undergo dilatation. Such dilatation 
results in signiﬁcant internal stress that can ultimately lead 
to the fracture of materials, which is beneﬁcial for the ini- 
tial activation caused by the exposure of the native surface 
without oxides. Nevertheless, a greater dilatation is generally 
not preferred when considering the practical applications of 
hydrogen storage alloys because dilatation restricts the initial 
ﬁlling density of the hydrogen storage alloy in the container 
[ 88 ]. Consequently, a hydrogen storage alloy with low di- 
latation is preferred to enhance its economic feasibility. The 
dilation owing to the hydrogenation reaction was calculated 
using the following equation: 
V = Vh −Vm 
Vm 
,
(5) 
where Vm and Vh are the volumes of the hydrogen storage 
alloy and hydride, respectively. These values at 0 K were 
readily obtained by the DFT calculations. Fig. 4 presents the 
results of dilatation due to the hydrogenation reaction involv- 
ing MgH2 hydrides. The calculated values of 31.8 % for α- 
MgH2 and 29.39 % for γ -MgH2 are in fairly good agreement 
with experimentally reported volume changes of 31.4 % for 
α-MgH2 and 29.1 % for γ -MgH2 [ 59 , 89 ]. As illustrated in 
Fig. 4 , both α-MgH2 and γ -MgH2 exhibit a clear decrease 
in the dilation when alkali metals (K, Rb, Cs) and alka-

provides only qualitative information, and a comprehensive 
review of the characteristics of each alloying element is re- 
quired for the proper design of Mg-based hydrogen storage 
alloys.

3.2. Analysis of solute element sublattice site preference in 
Mg2 Ni based on DFT calculations 
We now examine the role of the solute elements in Mg2 Ni- 
based hydrogen storage alloys. It is worth examining the de- 
tailed site preference of each alloying element ﬁrst because 
it can signiﬁcantly affect the overall performance of Mg2 Ni- 
based hydrogen storage alloys. We examined the site prefer- 
ence by considering possible off-stoichiometric compositions, 
as well as the stoichiometric composition ( i.e. , Mg:Ni = 2:1). 
First, the site preference of each alloying element when 
present in the exact Mg2 Ni stoichiometric compound was cal- 
culated based on the concept of standard defect formation 
energy [ 90 ]. 
EX→Mg site = 

E( Mg47 X1 Ni24 ) + EMg 

−

E( Mg48 Ni24 ) + EX 

(6) 
EX→Ni site = 

E( Mg48 Ni23 X1 ) + ENi 

−

E( Mg48 Ni24 ) + EX 

(7) 
Here, E (Mg48 Ni24 ) is the energy of the superlattice without 
substitution. E (Mg47 X1 Ni24 ) and E (Mg48 Ni23 X1 ) represent the 
energy values when the solute element (X) is present at the 
Mg and Ni sites, respectively. The energy values obtained 
using Eqs. (6) and (7) were compared to determine the relative 
stabilities of the solute elements (X) at both sites using the 
following equation: 
EMg site →Ni site = EX→Ni site −EX→Mg site 
(8) 
A positive sign of EMg site → Ni site suggests that the solute 
element (X) prefers the Mg site over the Ni site, and vice 
versa . 
Although predictions using standard defect formation ener- 
gies provide valid information regarding the site preferences 
of solute elements in intermetallic compounds, this method 
has a limitation in that the tendency changes depending on 
the arbitrary choice of the reference states of pure Mg and 
Ni. Moreover, this method is valid only for the prediction of 
stoichiometric compositions. If the composition of the com- 
pound phase deviates from the Mg2 Ni stoichiometric compo- 
sition ( i.e. , Mg- or Ni-rich compositions), the examined site 
preferences may differ depending on the composition. If the 
composition deviates from the Mg2 Ni stoichiometric compo- 
sition, antisite defects or vacancies must be present in the 
compound, and these defects can affect the site preference of 
each alloying element. 
Therefore, we additionally performed the investigation of 
the site preference based on an alternative method that con- 
siders off-stoichiometric compositions. We considered off- 
stoichiometric compounds with only antisite defects, rather 
than vacancies because we expect the number of vacancies 
in the Mg2 Ni-based hydrogen storage alloy to be very small 
compared to the number of antisite defects at the usual operat- 
ing temperature, which is far below its melting point. Predic- 
tions for the Mg- and Ni-rich alloys were individually made 
using Eqs. (9) and (10) , respectively.

(10) 
In Eq. (9) , E [(Mg48 ),(Ni23 X1 )] represents the energy of 
a Mg-rich supercell with a solute X atom at the Ni site. 
E [(Mg47 X1 ),(Ni23 Mg1 )] represents the energy of a Mg-rich 
supercell with a solute X atom at the Mg site and an antisite 
Mg atom at the Ni site. As these two energy values were 
calculated based on supercells with exactly the same com- 
position, there was no ambiguity in the predictions related 
to the arbitrary choice of reference states. Eq. (10) can be 
deﬁned similarly. The calculated results for the Mg- and Ni- 
rich alloys are shown in Figs. 5 (c and d), respectively, and the 
predicted site preferences are listed in Table 6 . Fig. 5(d) in- 
dicates that all the solute elements exhibited a preference for 
Mg sites in the Ni-rich compounds. This implies that the Ni 
antisite defect present at the Mg site is highly unstable and 
that the solute atom replacing the Ni antisite defect can lower 
the overall energy value. 
By calculating the site preference of alloys with off- 
stoichiometric Mg- and Ni-rich compositions, we suggest an 
alternative criterion for predicting stoichiometric Mg2 Ni com- 
pounds. By averaging the values obtained from Eqs. (9) and 
(10) , the site preferences of stoichiometric compounds can be 
predicted.

Mg site → Ni site =

E ( Mg−rich ) 
T i site → Mn site + E ( Ni−rich ) 
T i site → Mn site

(11) 
The prediction of the site preference obtained using 
Eq. (11) is more advantageous than Eq. (8) because it is 
independent of the selection of reference states for pure 
Mg and Ni. The site preferences of stoichiometric com- 
pounds predicted using Eq. (8) and the results predicted us- 
ing Eq. (11) are compared in Fig. 5 (a and b), respectively. 
The predictions of the stoichiometric compounds based on 
both methods exhibited similar trends, whereas certain ele- 
ments (As, Ge, Mn, Si, and Zn) exhibited a mismatch in sign. 
However, the absolute values for these elements are relatively 
small, which indicates the possibility that these elements can 
be present at both Mg and Ni sites without a clear site pref- 
erence. 
The calculated predictions of the off-stoichiometric com- 
pounds presented in Table 6 and Figs. 5 (c and d) indicate the 
following tendency: if a Mg-rich base compound is consid- 
ered, an additional solute element favors the Ni site rather 
than the Mg site, and vice versa . This is because the Mg- 
rich compound already contains Mg antisite defects in the 
Ni sublattice. If a solute element is added to this Mg-rich 
compound, there are two choices of substitution: the place- 
ment of a solute atom substituting a Mg atom at the Mg 
sublattice or the placement of a solute atom substituting an

Mg antisite defect at the Ni sublattice; however, the latter 
type of substitution is usually preferred because the anti- 
site defect itself is somewhat unstable owing to its defec- 
tive nature. However, this trend is not absolute, with different 
trends observed for each element. For example, Ba, Ca, Cs, 
Gd, Hf, K, La, Na, Nb, Nd, Rb, Sc , Sr, Ta, Ti, Y, and Zr 
exhibit Mg site preferences regardless of the stoichiometry 
of the base compound. For elements with a strongly pre- 
ferred Mg site, the adjustment of the bulk composition of 
the alloys is restricted to a Ni-rich composition to maintain 
a single-phase compound. In other words, the bulk composi- 
tion should be adjusted in the same manner as Mg(2-x) Tix Ni

to maintain a single-phase hydrogen storage alloy. We expect 
that the adjustment of the bulk composition deviates in this 
manner ( i.e. , Mg2 Ni1-x Tix ), resulting in the presence of un- 
wanted secondary phases ( e.g. , solid solutions, precipitates, 
or inclusions) that can reduce the total hydrogen storage ca- 
pacity or the presence of hcp Mg-rich solid solutions. Pre- 
vious experiments on adding Ti to Mg2 Ni alloys with bulk 
compositions of Mg1.9 Ni1 Ti0.1 [ 91 ], Mg2 Ni1-x Tix ( x = 0.08, 
0.12, and 0.16) [ 42 ], and Mg2 Ni0.7 Ti0.3 [ 92 ] have reported this 
predicted tendency. Among these, only the Mg1.9 Ni1 Ti0.1 al- 
loy [ 91 ] exhibited the single-phase Mg2 Ni-based compound. 
The Mg2 Ni1-x Tix ( x = 0.08, 0.12, and 0.16) alloy [ 42 ] ex- 
hibited the dual phases of a solid solution and Mg2 Ni-based 
compound, whereas the Mg2 Ni0.7 Ti0.3 alloy [ 92 ] exhibited the 
dual phases of Mg3 TiNi2 and Mg2 Ni-based compounds. 
3.3. Enthalpy of hydrogenation reactions for Mg2 Ni-based 
storage alloys 
Based on our understanding of the site preferences of each 
alloying element, we extended our interest to the properties 
of the Mg2 Ni-based compound phase. The methodology pre- 
viously employed for the Mg-based solid solution phase was 
similarly applied to the Mg2 Ni-based compound phase. Espe- 
cially, DFT calculations were performed to obtain the energy 
( Er ) changes due to the following hydrogenation reaction: 
Er = E( Mg48 Ni24 H96 ) −E( Mg48 Ni24 ) −48 E( H2 ) 
48 
, (12) 
where E (Mg48 Ni24 H96 ) and E (Mg48 Ni24 ) represent the DFT 
energy values of the supercells with the hydride and com- 
pound phases, respectively. To examine the effects of the 
solute elements, a dilute concentration of solute elements, 
where a single substitutional atom X is located in a super- 
cell ( e.g. , Mg47 X1 Ni24 H96 and Mg48 Ni23 X1 H96 ), was consid- 
ered. For the Mg sites of the Mg2 NiH4 hydride, three dis- 
tinct sites (Mg1, Mg2, and Mg3, as shown in Fig. 2 ) were 
treated separately as possible substitutional sites. The ob- 
tained hydrogenation energy ( Er ) is presented in Table 7 and 
Fig. 6 . 
As listed in Table 3 , the Er of Mg2 Ni without a solute 
atom was calculated to be −57.06 kJ/mol H2 ; this value is 
presented in Table 7 as a reference. Several values in Ta- 
ble 7 are shaded gray, which indicates impractical cases ac- 
cording to the predicted site preference results in Fig. 5(b) . 
These elements ( e.g. , Ba, Ca, Cs, Gd, Hf, K, La, Na, Nb, 
Nd, Rb, Sc , Sr, Ta, Ti, Y, and Zr) always prefer Mg sites, re- 
gardless of stoichiometry. As shown in Fig. 6 , the stability of 
hydrides varies signiﬁcantly depending on the type of solute 
element and its presented site ( i.e. , the Mg or Ni site). 
The effect of solute elements on changes of the dilatation 
( V ) due to the hydrogenation reaction of Mg2 Ni alloys is 
also calculated and summarized in Table 7 and Fig. 7 . The 
DFT results indicated that the Mg2 Ni compound without ad- 
ditional solute elements resulted in a volume expansion of 
30.49 % owing to the hydrogenation reaction. This prediction 
is consistent with the reported experimental values of 31.9 % 
[ 93 ] and 32.4 % [ 94 ], demonstrating the predictive accuracy 
of the DFT calculations. The data enabled the comparison of 
the dilatations resulting from the substitution of solute ele- 
ments at different sites. 
A comparison of the predictions by DFT calculations with 
the reported experimental trends is presented in Table 8 , 
which illustrates the impact of various solute elements on 
the changes in the PCT curves of the ternary Mg2 Ni-based 
hydrogen storage alloys. For example, an experimental work 
on Mg2-x Alx Ni1 ( x = 0, 0.1) by Li et al. [ 95 ] reported that 
adding Al destabilizes ( i.e. , increase in plateau pressures) the 
hydride phase, consistent with the predicted DFT results; we 
can interpret this tendency as follows: (i) The Mg2-x Alx Ni1 
composition was selected to be Ni-rich compared to the stoi- 
chiometric Mg2 Ni1 compound. (ii) We expect the Al atoms in 
the Ni-rich alloy to be preferentially present at the Mg sites, 
as shown in Table 6 . (iii) The Al atoms at the Mg sites re- 
sults in the destabilization of the hydride phase ( i.e. , increase 
in Er ) as shown in Table 7 . 
As another example, we can compare the results of iden- 
tifying the effect of Cu addition on alloys with a Mg-rich 
composition. Moreover, the predictions for Ag, Cu, Ca, Cr, 
Mn, Y, and Ti derived from the DFT calculations are also 
in general agreement with the reported experimental trends. 
According to an experimental study on Mg2 Ni1-x Cux ( x = 0–
0.15) alloys by Si et al. [ 43 ], adding Cu resulted in an in- 
crease in plateau pressures. Our DFT calculations predict that 
additional Cu atoms in the Mg-rich alloy are preferentially 
present at the Ni sites ( Table 6 ), and this addition results 
in the destabilization of the hydride phase ( Table 7 ), which 
is consistent with the experimental trend. In particular, the 
agreement between the experimental results and DFT predic- 
tions for the role of Ca, the only solute element showing 
a stabilizing effect among the elements in Table 7 , empha- 
sizes the credibility of the DFT prediction. Our DFT calcu- 
lations predicted that Ca positioned at the Mg site stabilizes 
the hydride phase—a trend also reported in a previous ex- 
periment [ 97 ], which demonstrated that incorporating Ca in 
Mg2 Ni compounds, e.g. , Mg62 Ca5 Ni33 , results in the lowering 
of plateau pressures. 
Moreover, it is interesting to note that the prediction 
is not only valid for the direction of changes ( i.e. , stabi- 
lization or destabilization) but also for the magnitude of 
changes. For example, a previous experiment by Zhong et a l. 
[ 92 ] reported that the increasing trend in the plateau pres- 
sures of the Mg2 Ni0.7 Al0.3 alloy was greater than that of 
the Mg2 Ni0.7 Mn0.3 alloy, and this trend was consistently ob- 
served in DFT calculations. The overall agreement between 
the present DFT calculations and the experimental trends 
demonstrates the reliability of the present predictions, and 
thus the present results provide useful information for adding 
solute elements not yet explored in previous experiments. 
3.4. Electronic properties of Mg2 NiH4 hydrides 
Finally, we investigated the underlying mechanisms of the 
effect of solute elements on the properties of hydrogen stor-

shown in Fig. 2 . Results at impractical conditions, expected from the site preference prediction results in Fig. 5 , are indicated in gray shading. The results 
considering the predicted site preference of the stoichiometric Mg2 Ni compound in Fig. 5 (b) are emphasized in bold.

age alloys by analyzing the electronic properties of Mg2 NiH4 
hydrides. In particular, we analyzed the role of the solute ele- 
ments by evaluating the density of states (DOS) and bonding 
characteristics using DFT calculations. Since there are a large 
number of solutes considered in the present study, we selected 
four example alloying elements considering tendencies of the 
site preference and Er . For elements that preferentially sub- 
stitute the Mg site, Sb and Ba were selected because of their 
opposite tendencies to destabilize and stabilize the hydride 
phase, respectively. For elements that preferentially substitute 
the Ni sites, P and Ru were selected because of their oppo- 
site tendencies to destabilize and stabilize the hydride phase, 
respectively. Additionally, Na was selected as an example el- 
ement that has only a marginal effect on hydride stability.

Fig. 7. Visualization of the impact of additional solute elements on the volume change due to the hydrogenation reaction ( V ) of Mg2 Ni alloys from data 
listed in Table 7 . Results considering a substitutional solute atom at the (a) Mg site and (b) Ni site are presented. Averaged values for different Mg sites ( e.g. , 
Mg1, Mg 2, and Mg3 in Fig. 2 ) are shown in (a). 
Fig. 8 shows the examined DOS of the hydrides with- 
out ( e.g. , Mg48 Ni24 H96 ) and with ( e.g. , Mg47 X1 Ni24 H96 and 
Mg48 Ni23 X1 H96 ) solute atom X . The total density of states 
(TDOS) and partial density of states (PDOS) are shown sep- 
arately displayed in the ﬁgure. These analyses were conducted 
to analyze the electronic structure and gain insight into the 
detailed mechanisms of the inﬂuence of the solute elements. 
Fig. 8(a) shows the TDOS of Mg48 Ni24 H96 and the partial 
density of states (PDOS) of the constituent elements ( i.e. , 
Mg, Ni, and H), which enable a comprehensive understand- 
ing of the electronic structure of the Mg2 NiH4 hydride. Ex- 
amination of the TDOS reveals a bandgap of approximately 
1.53 eV between the valence and conduction bands, exhibit- 
ing the characteristics of a semiconductor. The TDOS peak 
in a range between the energy of −2.5 eV and the Fermi 
energy ( Ef ) is predominantly characterized by the Ni d or- 
bital. This range is also characterized by superposition with 
Mg orbitals, whereas the overall DOS values are small. PDOS 
analysis reveals that the Ni d orbital is the primary contrib- 
utor to the electronic states near the Fermi level and plays 
a signiﬁcant role in bonding with hydrogen atoms. The Ni d 
orbitals have a higher spatial overlap with the H s orbitals, al- 
lowing for stronger hybridization and more effective electron 
sharing between the Ni and H atoms. This results in a deeper 
potential well and stronger binding between Ni and H atoms. 
Conversely, the Mg atoms primarily contribute through s and 
p orbitals, which have less directional overlap with the H s 
orbitals, resulting in weaker bonding interactions. The differ- 
ence in bonding strength between Ni-H and Mg-H is crucial 
to the thermodynamic stability of Mg2 NiH4 hydride, with the 
stronger Ni-H bonds playing a signiﬁcant role in enhancing 
the hydride’s overall stability. This ﬁnding is in accordance 
with previous DFT results [ 102 , 103 ]. 
Fig. 8 (c and d) illustrate the DOS of the hydrides with P 
and Sb atoms at the Ni and Mg3 sites, respectively, which 
exhibit a destabilization trend of the hydrides. Fig. 8 (e and f) 
illustrate the DOS of the hydrides with Ru and Ba atoms at 
the Ni and Mg3 sites, respectively, which exhibit a stabiliza- 
tion trend of the hydrides. Upon the substitution of Mg with 
Sb ( Fig. 8(d) ), a transition to metallic behavior is observed,

characterized by the collapse of the band gap and the appear- 
ance of states at the Fermi level. Moreover, the TDOS reveals 
an increase in the density of states at higher energy levels, 
particularly above the Fermi level, where the Sb p orbitals in- 
troduce additional states that contribute to the destabilization 
of the system. This destabilization is linked to an increase in 
the DOS at elevated energy states, which enhances the elec- 
tronic excitability and reduces the energy required for elec- 
tron transitions, thereby facilitating a less stable electronic 
environment. The increase in high-energy DOS reﬂects the 
introduction of less-bound electronic states available for ther- 
mal excitation and contributes to the overall instability of the 
hydride. The presence of Sb atoms disrupts the original Ni- 
H bonding network by introducing localized electronic states 
that interfere with the cohesive forces between hydrogen and 
the neighboring metal atoms. These additional states create 
electron localization around Sb, weaken the Ni-H and Mg-H 
interactions, and render the system more prone to electronic 
ﬂuctuations and instability. The overall effect is to signiﬁ- 
cantly reduce the stability of the hydrides, which aligns with 
the goal of enhancing hydrogen release during the desorption 
process. 
In contrast, the substitution of Mg with Ba ( Fig. 8 (f)) main- 
tains the semiconducting nature of the Mg2 NiH4 hydride, with 
only a slight reduction in the band gap, preserving a rela- 
tively stable electronic structure. The PDOS shows that the 
Ba d orbitals enhance bonding interactions with hydrogen, 
as evidenced by the increased contributions of Ba states be-

low the Fermi level. This result indicates that the H atom 
contributes signiﬁcantly to the valence electrons, suggesting 
that the bonding interaction between H and the nearby metal 
atoms is strengthened. In general, the greater the number of 
bonding electrons, the stronger the charge interaction, which 
increases the structural stability of the system [ 104 ]. This sug- 
gests that although the Ba atom introduces some electronic 
modiﬁcations, it predominantly reinforces the existing metal- 
H bonding framework rather than destabilizing it. 
The supporting observations from Fig. 8 (b, c and e) pro- 
vide further insights into the contrasting effects of the so- 
lute elements. Na substitution induces minimal changes in 
the electronic structure, reﬂecting its limited impact on the 
stability of the hydride, as shown in Fig. 8(b) . In contrast, 
P substitution slightly reduces the band gap and introduces 
states near the conduction band, partially destabilizing the 
hydride, as shown in Fig. 8(c) . As illustrated in Fig. 8(e) , 
the Ru substitution enhances the interaction between Ru and 
H, leading to a localized electron density that contributes to 
maintaining the stability of the hydride. 
Overall, the results demonstrate that solute elements such 
as Sb and P effectively destabilize Mg2 NiH4 hydride by mod- 
ifying the electronic landscape, particularly through the intro- 
duction of high-energy states that facilitate electronic instabil- 
ity. In contrast, elements such as Ba and Ru either preserve 
or slightly reinforce metal-H bonds, resulting in a more sta- 
ble hydride phase. These ﬁndings highlight the importance of 
selecting the appropriate alloying elements to tailor the elec- 
tronic properties of hydrides. This approach helps achieve the 
desired balance between the destabilization of hydrides for 
enhanced hydrogen desorption and the maintenance of the 
thermodynamic stability of hydrides for enhanced hydrogen 
storage capacity, which is crucial for practical applications of 
hydrogen storage alloys. 
In the present study, the electron localization function 
(ELF) was examined to elucidate the effect of solute atoms 
on bonding characteristics. As illustrated in Fig. 9 , regions 
with an ELF value near 1.0, represent a case where elec- 
trons are fully localized. In regions with an ELF value below 
0.5, the Pauli repulsion becomes more pronounced than in a 
uniform electron gas, indicating that electrons are dispersed 
and delocalized in those regions. Fig. 9 (a, b, e, and f) depict 
the ELF plots of the Mg48 Ni24 H96 hydride. As illustrated in 
Fig. 9 , red regions surrounding the H atoms, which exhibit 
ELF values of 0.9–1.0, indicate that the electrons are highly 
localized. In contrast, the blue regions at the positions of the 
Ni and Mg atoms indicate that the metal atoms are in the 
delocalization situation. Substantial ELF values between the 
metal and H indicate the presence of a covalent-like bond, 
while a certain level of ionic bonding also occurs as a result 
of electron donation from the metal to the H atoms. Upon 
examination of Fig. 9 (c and g) for solute elements (Sb and 
P) that destabilize the hydride phase, the presence of those 
atoms leads to an overall shrinkage of the highly localized 
regions (ELF values of 0.9 – 1.0) near the H atoms. A reduc- 
tion in the electron density surrounding the hydrogen atoms 
indicates weakening of the interaction between hydrogen and 
the metal atoms. Fig. 9 (d and h) illustrate a contrasting trend 
for the solute elements (Ba and Ru) that stabilize the hydride 
phase. The substitution of the Ba and Ru atoms resulted in 
a more localized distribution of electrons around the hydro- 
gen atoms. These observations explain why hydrogen storage 
properties vary signiﬁcantly depending on the individual so- 
lute elements. 
4. Conclusion 
First-principles DFT calculations were performed to ana- 
lyze the impact of various solute elements on the performance 
of Mg-Mg2 Ni hydrogen storage alloys. We investigated the 
important characteristics of hydrogen storage alloys by con- 
sidering both Mg-based solid solution and Mg2 Ni-based in- 
termetallic compound phases, where the hydride forms are 
MgH2 and Mg2 NiH4 , respectively. In particular, qualitatively 
valid information for predicting changes in plateau pressures 
in the PCT curve was provided by calculating changes in 
the energy of related hydrogenation reactions. The effects of 
alloying elements on volume changes due to hydrogenation 
reactions were also obtained to provide additional criteria for 
the practical use of hydrogen storage alloys. For the Mg2 Ni- 
based intermetallic compound, we examined the site prefer- 
ence of each alloying element, considering the designated sto- 
ichiometry of the base alloy. Based on the revealed site pref- 
erences, the effects of various possible alloying elements on 
the properties of Mg2 Ni-based hydrides were also examined. 
Electronic structure analyses were further conducted to eluci- 
date the detailed mechanisms underlying the role of the addi- 
tional solute elements. The results of this study provide mean- 
ingful data for designing Mg-Mg2 Ni-based hydrogen storage 
alloys.
