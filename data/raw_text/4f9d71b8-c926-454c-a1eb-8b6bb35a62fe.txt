ABSTRACT: In this study, we investigate how structural modifications induced by Fe
substitution with Ni in the TiFe intermetallic alloy affect the thermodynamics of hydride
formation and decomposition. The primary goal of substituting Fe with Ni was to reduce
the plateau pressure of TiFe, a crucial parameter for reversible solid-state hydrogen storage
applications under near-ambient conditions (below 150 °C and 50 bar). Alloy
compositions TiFe1−xNix with x ≤0.30 were synthesized by arc melting. The structural
and morphological properties were characterized using powder X-ray diffraction and
scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The thermody-
namic properties were investigated through volumetric measurements using a Sieverts’
apparatus and calorimetric analysis with a high-pressure differential scanning calorimeter.
We show that Ni incorporation effectively lowers the plateau pressure, stabilizing the
hydride thermodynamics due to a more negative enthalpy of hydride formation. Moreover, the entropy of hydride formation
increases with the Ni content, resulting in a linear correlation between the enthalpy and entropy values determined at different
compositions. The enthalpy−entropy compensation effect was analyzed to determine whether it arises from statistical artifacts or is
genuine to the system, as our findings suggest.

1. INTRODUCTION
Hydrogen is progressively recognized as a critical component
in transitioning to a low-carbon energy future, as highlighted
by the International Energy Agency (IEA) roadmap.1,2 It is a
versatile energy carrier, important especially in hard-to-abate
sectors like heavy industry, aviation, and long-distance
transportation, which makes it a key element in the future
energy landscape.3
However, the general adoption of hydrogen relies on
overcoming several technical and economic limitations, with
storage representing one of the most substantial.4 Current
storage methods, including high-pressure gas tanks, cryogenic
liquid storage, and solid-state metal hydrides, have constraints
in cost, efficiency, and energy density.5
The need for a practical storage system that meets
operational ambient conditions, such as when coupled with
electrolyzers and fuel cells, has renewed interest in metal
hydride chemical storage. Among materials considered for
solid-state hydrogen storage, TiFe-based alloys are particularly
promising for stationary applications due to their balanced
combination of low cost, low environmental impact,
reversibility, and favorable hydrogen sorption kinetics.6−8
The cost of the materials can be even lower if iron and
titanium are recovered from other industrial processes.9
These alloys operate effectively at moderate temperatures
and pressures below 100 bar and 100 °C. The maximum
reported gravimetric and volumetric densities at 25 °C (70
bar) are 1.87 wt% and 105 kg m−3, respectively.10 These
properties make them suitable for practical applications under
ambient conditions.6
Reilly and Wiswall11 were the first to describe the properties
of iron−titanium hydrides. They reported the existence of two
ternary hydrides: FeTiH≈1 (β phase) and FeTiH≈2 (γ phase).
They estimated the critical temperature for the β−γ transition
to be close to 55 °C. The transition between these two phases
is almost continuous in the temperature range that we have
investigated, represented by an almost linear variation of
concentration with pressure. For this work, we have decided to
limit the H2 pressure to 30 bar, the maximum output pressure
of most commercial electrolysis systems.12

TiFe exists in a narrow compositional range, from 49.5 to
52.5 at% Ti at 1000 °C, crystallizing in the CsCl-type structure
(space group Pm3̅m).13 Secondary phases emerge outside this
compositional interval, on both the Ti-rich and Fe-rich sides,
significantly altering the hydride sorption properties. As an
example, Ti4Fe2O-type phases (cubic phase, space group
Fd3̅m)14 form on the Ti-rich side when oxygen contamination
occurs. In a recent work, Liu et al.15 have investigated the role
of these suboxides as gateways for hydrogen absorption and
easier activation. While these phases can absorb hydrogen, they
show a reduced total capacity compared to pure TiFe. Zavaliy
et al. reported a maximum gravimetric density for Ti4Fe2O0.25
of 1.58 wt% at RT, 1.5 bar.14 The high stability of these
hydrides, which show decomposition temperatures14 above
200 °C, can therefore lead to a total reduction of the maximum
reversible storage capacity.
Significant challenges must be addressed to transition these
compounds from laboratory-scale prototypes to industrial-scale
operating systems. These include harsh activation conditions
typically a 400 °C heat treatment under a pressurized hydrogen
atmosphere6,16 and a strong dependence of hydrogen
storage performancetotal capacity, pressure−temperature
conditions, and hydrogen uptake/release rateon precise
stoichiometric composition, including the presence of
secondary phases, substitutions, or impurities.13
One way to improve the thermodynamic and kinetic
properties of these alloys while addressing the activation
issue concerns stoichiometric tailoring, which involves adjust-
ing the ratio of titanium (Ti) to iron (Fe) and incorporating
substitutional elements, such as V, Cr, Co, Ni, Mn, or Zr.6
These substitutions can alter the phase stability and sorption
behavior by affecting the microstructure and electronic
structure of the alloy, potentially improving activation
conditions,16 cyclability,17 and thermodynamic and kinetic
performances.18 However, this may result in a reduction of the
total capacity of the compound,13 often caused by the
formation of precipitates and secondary phases, which do
not react with hydrogen or form stable hydrides.
This study aims to investigate the effect of Ni partial
substitution of Fe in the TiFe1−xNix system, focusing on its
thermodynamic properties.
Nickel is now classified as a critical raw material by the
European Union,19 meeting the conditions to be considered a
strategic raw material, as its importance in the strategic
technologies, related to the energy transition and defense,
grows. Nevertheless, its supply chain remains solid, and its
adoption as a substituent is a viable solution given its low
toxicity and high recyclability.20
In substituting Fe with Ni, Mintz et al.21 reported an
increased stability of the monohydride phase and a decreased
stability of the dihydride phase. They also reported a
significant decrease in the hysteresis. More recent studies
have also shown that partially substituting Fe with Ni in the
TiFe1−xNix system can lower the plateau pressure. This
adjustment potentially leads to easier activation16 and
enhanced hydride stability.18,22,23 Interestingly, the relationship
between Ni substitution, unit cell expansion, and some aspects
of the resulting thermodynamics has not yet been fully
explored.16 For instance, enthalpy−entropy compensation
(EEC) is often observed in chemical and biological processes
and manifests as a linear correlation between the enthalpy and
the entropy of reaction.24 The existence of the EEC has an
impact on the tailoring of thermodynamic properties via
elemental substitution. In this work, we apply a recently
developed statistical test to assess whether the observed
correlation between the enthalpy and entropy with varying
nickel contents is a genuine effect.
By systematically varying the Ni content in the range x ≤
0.30, we seek to understand how unit cell expansion resulting
from Ni incorporation impacts the enthalpy and entropy of
hydride formation and decomposition, which in turn affects the
operational temperature−pressure conditions for hydrogen
sorption.
Given that Ni has a slightly smaller atomic radius compared
to Fe (rNi = 1.24 Å while rFe = 1.26 Å, where the atomic radius
is defined as half the internuclear distance between the two
nearest neighbors in the pure metal)25,26 but forms a weaker
Ti−Ni bond27 with a larger bond length compared to Ti−Fe,
its substitution is expected to expand the unit cell, facilitating
hydrogen accommodation in the interstitial sites.18
To characterize the thermodynamic properties of TiFe1−xNix
hydrides, we combine structural, microstructural, and composi-
tional analyses with volumetric and calorimetric measurements
using a Sieverts’ apparatus and a high-pressure differential
scanning calorimeter (HP-DSC). The key advantage of
coupling these techniques lies in the ability to analyze multiple
compounds more rapidly, gaining valuable insights into the
dependence of hydride thermodynamics on structural param-
eters and composition.
2. EXPERIMENTAL SECTION
2.1. Sample Synthesis. A total of six compounds were
synthesized, ranging from equiatomic TiFe (sample name: Ni0) to
TiFe0.70Ni0.30 (sample name: Ni30), as reported in Table 1. The alloys
were prepared by arc melting in an argon atmosphere on a water-
cooled copper plate, using an Edmund Bühler compact arc melter.
Each sample was melted three times on both sides to ensure structural
homogeneity. Bulky grains of Ti (Thermo Scientific, 1−2 mm,
99.9%), Fe (Thermo Scientific, 1−2 mm, 99.98%), and Ni wires
(Thermo Scientific, 0.5 mm, 99.98%) were mixed to achieve the
desired compositions. The average amount of material produced was
around 1.1 g with a weight loss after melting below 1%. For each
composition, two samples were synthesized: one underwent a

metallographic procedure, including high-precision cutting and cross-
sectional polishing in preparation for microanalysis. The other was
first crushed in a mortar and then ball milled for 10 min in a N2
atmosphere using a high-energy Spex CertiPrep 8000 mixer/mill,
equipped with stainless-steel balls at a ball-to-powder ratio of 10:1. A
total of two light balls (1 g each, 6.2 mm diameter) and one larger ball
(8 g, 12.7 mm diameter) were used for the mechanical treatment, and
the typical sample size was 1 g.
This mechanical treatment reduced the preferential orientation
observed in the X-ray diffraction profiles and facilitated the activation
process. Milling for a short period of time effectively cracks the
external passivating layer, exposing fresh surfaces ready to interact
with hydrogen.28 The obtained powder was used for all of the
subsequent analyses, as described below.
2.2. Structural and Compositional Characterization. Powder
X-ray diffraction (XRD) profiles were collected at ambient conditions
using an X’Pert Pro Panalytical Bragg−Brentano diffractometer
equipped with the X’Celerator multichannel solid-state detector and
a source of Cu Kα radiation. The 2θ range of 28−115° with a step
size of 0.017° and a time per step of 55 s was used for all samples. The
diffraction patterns were analyzed via Rietveld refinement29 using
MAUD software.30 The instrumental function was determined from
the Rietveld refinement of a reference LaB6 powder.
Compositional analyses on the polished cross sections were
conducted using a LEICA Cambridge Stereoscan 360 scanning
electron microscope (SEM) operated at 20 kV and equipped with an
Oxford Instruments 7060 detector for energy-dispersive X-ray
microanalysis (EDS). The calibration of the EDS was carried out
by using a cobalt reference according to standard practice. INCA
software was used to extract elemental compositions from the EDS
data. Each section was analyzed by local mapping on 10 spots to
check homogeneity; the standard deviation was used to determine the
uncertainty in the composition.
2.3. Thermodynamic Characterization. Pressure−composition
isotherms (PCIs) were measured using a custom Sieverts’ type
apparatus equipped with an MKS Baratron 750D13PCD2GA pressure
sensor, with a 1% accuracy on the readings. The typical mass of the
sample in a powder form was 1 g. The activation procedure involved
an isothermal treatment at 400 °C under 40 bar H2. Then, eight
absorption (under 40 bar H2) and desorption (in dynamic vacuum)
cycles at 100 °C were carried out to ensure complete activation. The
PCI curves were measured over the pressure range from 0.1 to 30 bar,
which is relevant for coupling electrolyzers that deliver H2 below 30
bar. This means that only the first plateau of the TiFeH system,
corresponding to the formation and decomposition of the
monohydride phase, was investigated, while the transition to
dihydride was not completed. Correspondingly, the temperature
range spanned from 30 to 170 °C. After each PCI cycle, samples were
exposed to dynamic vacuum for 20 min and then heated up to higher
temperatures.
The midplateau pressure values were used to determine the
absorption/desorption equilibrium points, from which the enthalpy
and entropy of formation and decomposition were extracted by Van ’t
Hoff analysis of the pressure−temperature data. The separate values
obtained for absorption and desorption are reported in Table S2. The
geometric mean of the absorption/desorption pressures was used to
determine the mean enthalpy ΔHPCI and entropy ΔSPCI reported in
Table 3.
Calorimetric measurements were conducted by using a TA
Instruments HP-DSC Q10 system. The instrument was calibrated
with indium, and a baseline correction was applied by using empty
sample and reference pans. The activation procedure consisted of an
initial thermal treatment similar to the one described for Sieverts’
apparatus and was completed by performing 10 absorption/
desorption ramps under 40 bar H2. Finally, heating/cooling ramps
from 50 to 350 °C with a scan rate of 5 °C/min were collected under
various H2 pressures in the 5−40 bar range. To obtain the enthalpy
and entropy of the sorption process from HP-DSC data, we identified
the temperature value that divides the integral area in half for each
ramp, resulting in TABS and TDES. This procedure enabled a more
reliable determination of the equilibrium temperature and pressure
compared to the straightforward use of peak temperature, typically
influenced by the process kinetics, as the onset temperature, which
can be, in addition, challenging to identify. The Van ‘t Hoff analysis
was then carried out using the average value of the former
temperatures plotted against the mean value of the corresponding
pressures.
3. RESULTS
3.1. Structural and Compositional Analysis. Table 1
lists the synthesized compositions and the elemental
abundances obtained from EDS microanalysis. The Ti content
in the samples ranges from 50.8 to 52.1 at%. While the Ti at%
is slightly higher than the nominal composition and the Fe at%
is correspondingly lower, neither Ti-rich particles nor other
secondary phases were detected by SEM observations of the
polished cross sections (Figure S1). This suggests a
homogeneous TiFe1−xNix matrix for all samples.
Figure 1 shows the XRD profile of Ni20; similar results were
obtained on the other samples, as displayed in Figure S2. The
main peaks are associated with the BCC B2 structure (space
group Pm3̅m), with a superlattice reflection at about 30°. In all
samples, two weak peaks at about 39 and 42° are detected,
which correspond to the most intense reflections of Ti4Fe2O,
one of the most common suboxides that form in these
systems.6,10,13 The latter phase shows a maximum abundance
of 5 wt% in Ni10 and no apparent correlation with the nickel
content. The absence of the suboxide particles in the SEM and
EDS analyses of polished cross sections suggests that the
secondary phase is either preferentially located at the external
surface of the samples or present in nanosized precipitates.
It is reasonable to assume that the excess Ti detected by
EDS, which may have been caused by stronger Fe and Ni
evaporation during melting, either occupies the Fe sites in TiFe
or is consumed by Ti4Fe2O formation. Thus, XRD profiles
have been fitted using a homogeneous TiFe phase with the
occupancy determined through EDS analysis, assuming that
both the excess Ti (≤2 at% in all samples) and the substituent
Ni occupy the Fe sites. A second iteration was then carried out,
correcting the excess Ti in TiFe based on the determination of
the Ti4Fe2O content; the results showed only minimal changes,
often within the experimental uncertainties, as expected given
the small amount of both suboxide and excess Ti. To further
test the sensitivity of the Rietveld analysis to the compositional
details, we compared the results to those obtained using the
Figure 1. XRD profile of sample Ni20. The positions of the Bragg
reflections of TiFe and Ti4Fe2O are indicated.

nominal compositions without excess Ti and found no
difference within the experimental uncertainties.
The lattice parameter (Table 2) of the equiatomic TiFe
composition Ni0 (2.978(3) Å) is compatible with values
reported in the literature (2.976 Å).6,10,13 Good agreement
with the literature is also observed in Ni-substituted
compounds.17,21,31 Notably, increasing the Ni content results
in monotonous lattice parameter enlargement up to 2.993 Å in
sample Ni30 (Figure 2). The linear fit in the explored regime
(the red line and inset in Figure 2) yields an extrapolated
lattice parameter aTiNi = 3.028(2) Å for Ni/(Ni + Fe) = 1. This
value is larger than the experimental one (3.015 Å) for TiNi,27
suggesting a nonideality of the TiFe1−xNix solid solution. The
change in the lattice parameter does not correlate with the
amount of excess Ti, confirming that Ni substitution for Fe is
the dominant cause of unit cell expansion.
The XRD analyses performed after PCI measurements on
hydride samples (see Figure S4) confirmed the structural
transformation from a cubic to orthorhombic TiFeH β-phase
(space group P2221).10,13 The detection of the suboxide phase
in this case was challenging, primarily due to the small molar
fraction of Ti4Fe2O and the overlap of its main Bragg
reflections with the broad TiFeH peaks.
3.2. Pressure−Composition Isotherms. The PCIs for
samples Ni0, Ni10, Ni20, and Ni30 are shown in Figure 3. Within
the investigated pressure range, all curves are characterized by
a single plateau corresponding to the formation and
decomposition of the monohydride β-phase. Above H/M ≈
1, an almost linear trend arises, corresponding to the beginning
of the transition to the dihydride γ-phase, which proceeds
continuously with the hydrogen content, as reported in the
literature.11
As shown in Table S1, the addition of Ni does not
significantly affect the gravimetric capacity: only a slight
reduction, often within the experimental uncertainty, is
observed when transitioning from pure TiFe to Ni-substituted
alloys with no clear correlation between storage capacity and
the Ni content. Specifically, Ni0 that has been tested up to
60 °C because of the high equilibrium pressure reached above
that temperature exhibits a maximum gravimetric density of
1.34(3) wt% at 30 °C and 30 bar. In the same pressure
conditions, at 100 °C, Ni10 achieves a total capacity of 1.23(3)
wt%, while Ni20 displays a slightly higher capacity of 1.32(3) wt
%, which drops down to 1.26(3) wt% for Ni30.
On the other hand, Ni substitution has a pronounced effect
on the pressure−temperature operational window because it
stabilizes the monohydride reducing its plateau pressure
compared to equiatomic TiFe. Figure 3 shows that the
absorption plateau pressure at 40 °C decreases from 12.8 bar
of Ni0 to 1.5 bar of Ni10, with a further reduction in Ni20 and
Ni30 even at higher temperatures. Samples with a high Ni
content are so stable that it is not possible to determine their
full PCIs below 80 °C because some equilibrium points are
below the reliable range of the pressure sensor. The
consequence of the increased stability is that, considering
operation in the 1−30 bar pressure range typical of storage
systems fed by a PEM electrolyzer and coupled with a fuel
cell the working temperatures and reversible gravimetric
densities vary substantially with the Ni content. For instance,
Ni30 can release only half of its reversible capacity at 1 bar
unless the temperature exceeds 100 °C. Ni10 and Ni20 achieve
reversible capacities between 1.2 and 1.3 wt% even at 100 °C,
where pure TiFe would require much higher absorption
pressure. The highest reversible capacities achievable in the 1−
30 bar pressure window, and the respective operational
temperatures determined from PCIs, are listed in Table S1.
The detailed p−T map reported in Table S2 for absorption and
desorption allows calculation of the maximum reversible
capacity for different pressure ranges, which may be of interest
for specific applications.
Increasing the Ni concentration results in a more sloped
plateau. This effect may be ascribed to small fluctuations of the
Ni content at the nanoscale, which correspond to a distribution
of local compositions. Indeed, inhomogeneities in the chemical
environment are typically responsible for the plateau sloping
effect,32,33 as they can vary hydrogen solubility or introduce
chemical potential gradients. Furthermore, we notice that
pressure hysteresis decreases with increasing both the temper-
ature and Ni content. It is generally accepted that hysteresis
originates from plastic deformation caused by the production
and annihilation of dislocations.34,35 The hysteresis tends to
decrease with increasing temperature because dislocation
motion is activated at a smaller level of stress, resulting in a
smaller plastic work. Inspection of Figure 3 reveals that
increasing the Ni content reduces the hysteresis at constant
temperature (compare for instance data at 100 °C for Ni10 and
Ni20). The atomistic mechanism behind the impact of Ni on
plastic deformation mechanisms and hysteresis is beyond the
scope of this work.

In general, the obtained thermodynamic data are in good
agreement with the ones reported in previous works.21,36−38
3.3. High-Pressure DSC. Figure 4 shows the calorimetric
profiles for samples Ni5 to Ni30 (exothermic signal up). From
the PCI characterization, we know that in the explored p−T
window, the high-pressure transition to the dihydride does not
occur or is just in its initial phase. Therefore, the high-
temperature shoulders visible in some HP-DSC peaks do not
correspond to a second process related to dihydride
decomposition (heating) and formation (cooling) because if
this was the case, then they should occur at the low-
temperature side, given the lower stability of the dihydride.
We suggest that the observed shoulders stem from different
kinetics in the initial and final part of the transformation due
for instance to a transition from a nucleation-limited to a
diffusion-limited process or from the presence of a multimodal
distribution of powder particle sizes. In particular, Ni30 displays
a broad shoulder for temperatures above the main peak.
The effect of a larger Ni content is evident in the shift of the
calorimetric peaks at 40 bar (Figure 5). As the Ni
concentration increases, the decomposition temperature rises,
confirming that Ni enhances the stability of the hydride. The
mean enthalpy and entropy obtained according to the
procedure outlined in Section 2 are reported in Table 3.
They show a clear dependence on composition, increasing in
absolute value with an increasing Ni content.
The temperature hysteresis tends to decrease with increasing
both the temperature and Ni content, a behavior similar to the
one observed in PCIs for the pressure hysteresis.

structure and stability has long been debated. Notably, Lundin
et al.27,39 proved the existence of a strong connection between
the tetragonal interstitial size in AB and AB5 hydrides and their
standard free energy of formation. In their investigation, they
observed an abnormal increase in the lattice parameters of
TiCo (2.991 Å) and TiNi (3.015 Å) compared to TiFe (2.976
Å), although the atomic radii of Co (1.25 Å)40 and Ni (1.24
Å)25 are similar to the one of Fe (1.26 Å). This effect has been
explained by variations in the bond strength among these
compounds. In TiFe, a quasi-ionic bond forms due to
increased electron exchange, making it stronger and tighter.
In contrast, the bonds in TiNi and TiCo are weaker, resulting
in larger lattice parameters, bigger interstitial sizes, and more
stable hydrides.27,39
In a recent study, Witman et al.41 emphasized the
importance of improving the predictability of hydride stability
using structural insights derived from machine learning (ML)
descriptors, such as the specific volume per atom (νpa
Magpie) for a
given composition: νpa
Magpie = ∑i
Nf iνi where f i is the atomic
fraction of element i and νi is the atomic volume in its ground-
state elemental solid form. All the AB5 compositions in their
analyzed data set showed consistent behavior, aligning with the
prediction that a larger νpa
Magpie corresponds to a lower plateau
pressure in the respective hydride. In our scenario, Ni has a
significantly smaller molar volume than Fe (6.59 and 7.09 cm3/
mol, respectively), resulting in a reduced νpa
Magpie, decreasing
from 8.91/NA cm3/atom for Ni0 to 8.83/NA cm3/atom for Ni30
(the molar volume of Ti being 10.64 cm3/mol and the
elemental fractions corresponding to the compositions
measured with EDS). Nonetheless, hydride stabilization is
still observed upon Ni incorporation due to the above-
mentioned unit cell expansion.
Interestingly, Cuevas et al.42 observed a 35% increase in the
enthalpy of formation of the investigated AB5 hydride due to a
4% expansion in the unit cell volume caused by the
incorporation of substituents such as Mn, Al, and Co. In
comparison, a 2% enlargement in the Ni-substituted TiFe
alloys analyzed in this work resulted in a 60% increase in the
stability. This difference can be explained by considering that
Cuevas et al. attributed the enhanced stability primarily to the
geometric expansion of the cell. In contrast, in our system,
incorporating Ni, which shows greater hydrogen affinity
compared to Fe, may contribute to stabilizing the hydride to
more negative enthalpy values.
We conclude that although νpa
Magpie is a powerful parameter
derived solely from the hydride composition, it is not a
universally significant descriptor. This limitation may arise
from its inability to account for the local atomic environment,
which is fundamental to fully understanding the behavior of a

specific material, as demonstrated by our TiFe1−xNix. Addi-
tional elemental parameters, such as the atomic radius, or
structural descriptors, like bond lengths and Vegard’s law
coefficient for the variation of the unit cell volume, could
provide a more comprehensive framework to better capture the
thermodynamics of hydride formation and decomposition.
4.2. Enthalpy−Entropy Compensation. As shown in
Figure 6 and Table 3, the structural modifications induced by
Ni substitution, primarily the expansion of the unit cell as the
Ni content increases, significantly affect the thermodynamics of
hydride formation and decomposition. These changes lead to
higher absolute values of both enthalpies and entropies,
resulting in more stable hydrides. The variation is more
pronounced at a low Ni content and tends to flatten when
going from Ni20 to Ni30.
Interestingly, a linear correlation exists between the enthalpy
and entropy values determined for different compositions, as
shown in Figure 7 for the data derived by HP-DSC, which is
also consistent with the trend shown by the results of PCI
analysis (Van ‘t Hoff plots in Figure 8). The apparent
enthalpy−entropy compensation (EEC) observed here is often
encountered in chemistry, biology, and physics. However, it is
often a matter of debate whether it is a genuine effect or a
statistical artifact, especially when a narrow temperature range
is explored.43
In a recent study, Griessen et al.24,43 proposed an approach
to determine whether the observed EEC arises from statistical
artifacts or is a genuine characteristic of the investigated
system. In contrast to the findings of Krug et al.,44,45 who
suggested comparing the compensation temperature (Tcomp)
obtained from the ΔH vs ΔS linear fit with the harmonic
temperature (Tharm) of the collected data, Griessen et al.
introduced a compensation quality factor (CQF) to account
for the coalescence of the Van ‘t Hoff plots, enabling a more
thorough examination of the compensation phenomenon.
By selecting a threshold value, γ[N; c.l.], which depends
solely on the number of investigated samples (N) and the
chosen confidence level (c.l.), it is possible to determine
whether the observed EEC is due to a statistical fit
compensation (i.e., a limited experimented temperature
range) or if it is intrinsic to the system, within the specified
confidence level.
In our case, as shown in the SI, Tcomp = 745.7 K, and
considering N = 5 and a 99% confidence level, we find that γ =
0.85, a smaller value than the CQF determined from our data
(CQF = 0.90, see the inset of Figure 7). Therefore, we can
conclude with 99% confidence that the EEC effect is genuine
and intrinsic to the system.
This leads to the conclusion that the increasing Ni
concentration in the intermetallic phase shifts the hydride
formation entropy toward larger absolute values, bringing it
closer to the standard molar entropy of gaseous H2 (130.77 J
K−1 mol−1H2).
This effect could be related to a reduction in the
configurational entropy contribution46 caused by the different
availability of interstitial sites per atom.47 The shift toward
more negative entropy values indicates that Ni-rich hydrides

have lower entropy. A possible reason for this is that Ni
modifies the local environment inducing a blocking effect that
prevents the hydrogen atoms to randomly accommodate in all
interstitial sites.48−50
Another possibility is that the vibrational entropy, especially
the one associated with light H atoms, is lower when Ni
replaces Fe. The separation of these effects and the
quantification of their relative contributions is not an easy
task, from both the experimental and theoretical points of view.
However, a deeper understanding of this topic promises, as a
reward, a greater degree of control over tailoring thermody-
namic properties through elemental substitution.
Revealing the presence of EEC and assessing its entity are
crucial for accurately estimating the hydride performance, as
the interplay between reaction enthalpy and entropy
significantly influences the outcomes. Furthermore, this
understanding provides insights into the relationship between
composition and thermodynamics in materials where this
effect occurs, enabling predictions for similar materials by using
computational tools such as machine learning.
4.3. Comparison between Results of PCIs and HP-
DSC. To explore the thermodynamics of hydride formation in
TiFe1−xNix, the current study combined the analysis of
equilibrium PCIs with nonequilibrium HP-DSC scans, with
the aim to establish a relationship between the enthalpy and
entropy of formation and decomposition and the structural
changes brought by Ni incorporation.
The comparison between the two methods is summarized in
Table 3 and Figure 6, while in Figure 8, we report the
compilation of all Van ’t Hoff plots. We can summarize by
saying that HP-DSC analysis tends to underestimate both the
enthalpy and entropy compared to the PCI. The relative
discrepancy is about 15% in the worst case (Ni10) and about
5% in the best case (Ni30). This discrepancy arises from a
nonaccurate determination of the equilibrium p−T couples,
which is unavoidable in nonequilibrium methods. Never-
theless, the qualitative assessment of the dependence of
enthalpy and entropy on composition is correctly determined
by the proposed HP-DSC peak analysis. This makes HP-DSC
a valuable tool for the rapid screening of the effects of
elemental substitution for a large number of compositions.
5. CONCLUSIONS
The general purpose of the present work was to investigate the
correlation between Ni-induced structural changes and hydride
sorption thermodynamics in TiFe1−xNix, using two comple-
mentary hydrogen sorption characterization techniques:
volumetric measurements with a Sieverts’ apparatus and
calorimetric measurements with a high-pressure DSC.
• Six compositions (x = 0, 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20, and 0.30)
were synthesized with an arc melter, obtaining highly
homogeneous and ordered BCC B2 structures, charac-
terized by a uniform TiFe phase with a minor amount
(<5 wt%) of Ti4Fe2O at the surface.
• The lattice parameter of the BCC B2 phase exhibits a
linear increase with an increasing Ni content. Ni
substitution results in a slight change in the total
gravimetric capacity associated with monohydride
formation while significantly impacting the hysteresis
and slope of the plateau pressures. The most visible
effect of Ni incorporation lies in the hydride
stabilization, which results in a remarkable reduction of
the equilibrium pressure, as shown in the PCIs. The
correlation between the unit cell volume and hydride
stability is qualitatively similar to the one reported for
AB5 compounds; however, the expanded volume does
not stem from the larger atomic size of the B substituent,
but from the weaker bonding with the A-site atom.
• Sieverts’ characterization can be coupled with faster HP-
DSC analysis, which gives a relative accuracy of about
10% in the obtained enthalpy−entropy values and a
correct qualitative assessment of compositional trends.
• A genuine enthalpy−entropy compensation effect was
observed as a function of the Ni content with a
confidence level of 99%.
Replacing Fe with Ni allows for tailoring the practical
conditions for reversible hydrogen sorption, thus matching the
requirements of specific applications. The need for higher
stability (i.e., a lower plateau pressure) may arise for several
reasons. For example, the storage system may be installed in a
location where the average temperature is well above 25 °C,
rising the plateau pressure of pure TiFe above 30 bar. A
hydride more stable than TiFeH, Ni10 or Ni20 depending on
the operational temperature range, would then be needed to be
compliant with the 30 bar output of a PEM electrolyzer. There
are also electrolyzers that operate at a pressure <30 bar12 that
would require coupling with a more stable hydride than
TiFeH. Another interesting example is the storage of hydrogen
produced by a photoelectrochemical reactor, which can only
operate at close to ambient pressure, due to the presence of
thin transparent windows. In this case, the coupling to a
TiFe1−xNix alloy with a carefully selected Ni content appears to
be the best option for long-term, footprint, and intrinsically
safe hydrogen storage.
